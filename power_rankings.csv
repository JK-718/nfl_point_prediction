2021,4,1,Los Angeles Rams,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 4 The marriage between Sean McVay and Matthew Stafford remains firmly in the honeymoon phase. Stafford shredded the Bucs for four touchdown passes in a surprisingly easy 34-24 win over the defending champs at rocking SoFi Stadium. Tom Brady threw for more than 400 yards in his first-ever game played in Los Angeles, but the Rams stuffed the Tampa run game and clamped down on Brady in the fourth quarter to close out another win. Yes, the Matthew Stafford Revitalization Project has yet to encounter an issue: Stafford's nine touchdown passes are tied for the most by a Rams quarterback in the first three games of a season. Los Angeles has the coaching and personnel to be elite on both sides of the ball -- when they put it together, it's a lethal combination. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿"
2021,4,2,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Is it too early to panic about the defense? The Buccaneers have allowed 300-plus passing yards and at least two passing touchdowns to each QB they've faced this season. Matthew Stafford was the latest passer to light them up in a 34-24 loss , Tampa Bay's first defeat since last November. Through three weeks, the defense has allowed 29.3 points per game, a full seven points higher than what it allowed in 2020. The Tom Brady -led offense will provide cover on most weeks, but the Bucs won the Super Bowl last season because they put it together on both sides of the ball. Tampa Bay has lost that balance, and it's on Todd Bowles to figure out how to restore it. Brady vs. Belichick looms next Sunday night. Any storylines worth following there?"
2021,4,3,Green Bay Packers,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ "" How can you not be romantic about football ?"" a whimsical Aaron Rodgers asked moments after he led the Packers on a final-minute field-goal drive to steal a win from the 49ers -- the same game the 49ers appeared ready to steal from the Packers only minutes before. It was that kind of night in Santa Clara, in the second Sunday Night Football classic in as many weeks. Rodgers was nails in those final seconds, connecting on two downfield strikes to Davante Adams to set up Mason Crosby 's game-winner from 51 yards out . The icy midfield handshake between Kyle Shanahan and Matt LaFleur added even more drama to a rivalry that deserves another chapter come January."
2021,4,4,Buffalo Bills,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bills have it cooking on both sides of the ball now. Josh Allen picked apart a supposedly good Washington defense with surgical precision, cutting perfect spirals through gusting winds like Joe Namath at Shea Stadium in a casually dominant 43-21 win over the Football Team. Allen's chemistry with his receivers was palpable on Sunday: Stefon Diggs made his usual assortment of impact plays and Cole Beasley showed off his uncanny knack for finding the defense's soft underbelly, while Emmanuel Sanders has profiled as a significant upgrade over John Brown . Buffalo might have the AFC East locked up by Thanksgiving."
2021,4,5,Baltimore Ravens,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Justin Tucker was already on a Hall of Fame track before Sunday in Detroit . He might have cemented his place in Canton with an NFL record-setting 66-yard field goal to beat the Lions and touch off a huge celebration at a suddenly silent Ford Field. Tucker's brilliance covered up for the sins of his team: Marquise Brown dropped three potential touchdown passes in the first half, and the Baltimore defense folded in the fourth quarter against a tepid Detroit offense. But the Ravens still had Tucker, the not-so-secret weapon who has dominated at his position for a decade. Said John Harbaugh : ""He's the best kicker in history."" There's nobody else even close."
2021,4,6,Kansas City Chiefs,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ In Week 2 against the Ravens, it was a Clyde Edwards-Helaire fumble that set up a tough loss. On Sunday against the Chargers, turnovers once again served as Kansas City's downfall. The Chiefs lost two fumbles and Patrick Mahomes threw two interceptions in a 30-24 loss to the Chargers at Arrowhead. Kansas City will turn the calendar to October in last place in the AFC West -- with three extremely frisky teams ahead of them in the standings. There was more bad news after the game, when we learned Andy Reid was transported to the hospital after falling ill. The trip to the hospital was precautionary, but any Reid absence from the sideline would stand as another imposing obstacle for the defending conference champs."
2021,4,7,San Francisco 49ers,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ They left too much damn time on the clock. Kyle Juszczyk's touchdown catch capped a 75-yard drive that put the 49ers ahead late in the fourth quarter, but the Niners failed to bleed the maximum amount of time off the clock before giving the ball back to Aaron Rodgers . The final 37 seconds were just enough for the Packers to move into Niners territory and boot the game-ending field goal in a 30-28 loss for San Francisco. This had to be especially painful for Kyle Shanahan, who made Rodgers trade inquiries during the MVP's offseason of squabbling with Green Bay. He didn't get his man, and now he had to watch helplessly as Rodgers stole away a win that could have huge ramifications in the NFC."
2021,4,8,Cleveland Browns,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 8 The 26-6 final score doesn't reflect just how badly the Browns beat up on the poor Bears. Cleveland was in total control from the opening kickoff, and Myles Garrett set a franchise record with 4.5 sacks, a performance that quiets talk of a slow start by the game's premier defensive end. Justin Fields was under constant duress as Chicago managed a single net yard of passing. The Browns continue to get impact performances from their running game, as well: Kareem Hunt totaled 155 total yards, including the game-sealing touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Then there's Odell Beckham , who made his season debut and looked like himself in a five-catch day. The Browns are in a good place. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿"
2021,4,9,Las Vegas Raiders,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Pro football in Las Vegas is thriving, and the Raiders are 3-0 for the first time since their Super Bowl season of 2002. Their 31-28 OT win over the Dolphins was a weird one: Miami scored the first 14 points, the Raiders ripped off the next 25, and then the 'Phins answered with the final 11 points of regulation to force OT. Derek Carr was nails once again in money time. His gorgeous, over-the-shoulder dime to Bryan Edwards went for 34 yards on second-and-15, the key play in the drive that ended with Daniel Carlson's game-winning field goal . Two home games with a crowd at Allegiant Stadium, and two classics for anyone lucky enough to be there. The Raiders are a vibe ."
2021,4,10,Los Angeles Chargers,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Brandon Staley is in love with his quarterback. Can you blame him? For the second straight week, the Chargers' head coach made a point to call Justin Herbert the best player on the field, this time after Herbert powered the Bolts to a dramatic 30-24 win over the Chiefs in Arrowhead. It's not lip service by Staley, either: On multiple occasions Sunday, Staley opted to keep his offense on the field rather than settle for sensible field-goal attempts. It was a tacit acknowledgement of Patrick Mahomes ' greatness, sure, but also a showing of supreme faith in his own guy. The Chargers converted first downs in each instance. The football world is quickly learning what Staley and the Power Rankings already knew: Justin Herbert Is A Savage In The Pocket."
2021,4,11,Arizona Cardinals,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The worst moment of Sunday was obvious: Kliff Kingsbury's misbegotten decision to let Matt Prater try a 68-yard field goal in the final seconds of the first half, a bold move rewarded with a 109-yard touchdown return by Jacksonville. Luckily for Kingsbury, the Cardinals have a superstar quarterback who can cover up for the sins of the head coach and others. Kyler Murray threw for 316 yards, and Arizona had two 100-yard receivers -- neither named DeAndre Hopkins -- in a 31-19 win over the hapless Jaguars. After the game, the Cardinals neatly spun the special teams catastrophe into an opportunity to display their apparent team growth. ""The last two years,"" Murray said , ""we would have lost that game for sure."" OK."
2021,4,12,Denver Broncos,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 13 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Sure, the Broncos' undefeated start has come at the expense of also-ran squads that are a combined 0-9 through three weeks, but let's give credit where credit is due: Vic Fangio has this team playing well on both sides of the football. The soft schedule is undeniable, but so too is the quality tape Denver has put out for three weeks. Fangio's balanced defense continued to feast on the top of the 2021 NFL Draft, shutting down No. 2 pick Zach Wilson one week after beating up on No. 1 pick Trevor Lawrence . The D's dominance has put Teddy Bridgewater and the offense in good position for three weeks. A Week 4 matchup against the Ravens should present a greater challenge all around."
2021,4,13,Carolina Panthers,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 18 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ""We're a football team. We're not the Carolina Christian McCaffreys ."" Panthers left tackle Cameron Erving struck a tone of defiance after McCaffrey exited Thursday night's win over the Texans with a hamstring injury that will likely cost him multiple weeks . The Panthers took advantage of a soft schedule to jump to a 3-0 start, but they enter the teeth of their slate without their superstar running back or rookie first-round pick Jaycee Horn , who broke multiple bones in his foot against Houston. Carolina addressed the secondary loss with a bold trade on Monday , sending tight end Dan Arnold and a third-round pick to the Jaguars for cornerback C.J. Henderson , last year's ninth overall pick."
2021,4,14,Dallas Cowboys,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Cowboys look like the best team in the NFC East -- and it's not particularly close right now. America's Team had its way with the Eagles on Monday Night Football , jumping out to an early lead and never looking back in a 41-21 win at Jerrah World. How lopsided was this matchup? The 'Boys had a 19-1 advantage in first downs by the end of the first half. Dak Prescott continues to play like a legitimate MVP candidate, and big performances by running back Ezekiel Elliott (116 total yards, two TDs), tight end Dalton Schultz (6/80/2) and emerging cornerback Trevon Diggs ( game-sealing pick-six ) have Dallas cutting the profile of a legitimate power player in the NFC."
2021,4,15,Tennessee Titans,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ On Sunday, the Titans lost A.J. Brown to a hamstring injury early, Mike Vrabel curiously decided to sit Julio Jones late, and they turned the ball over three times without creating a takeaway of their own. This might sound like the recipe for yet another disappointing loss to the Colts, but nope . The Titans have won back-to-back games, thanks to their dynamic stars at quarterback and running back. Ryan Tannehill made key plays with his arm and legs on a day he didn't have his usual cast of characters, while Derrick Henry grinded out 113 yards on 28 carries. Tanny & The Big Dog are more than an amazing fictional drive-time sports-radio duo -- they're the heart and soul of these Titans."
2021,4,16,Minnesota Vikings,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 24 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Vikings coach Mike Zimmer called it the best offensive game of his Vikings tenure. Kirk Cousins led Minnesota on three touchdown drives in the first half, then engineered a trio of second-half field-goal marches that chewed up more than 20 minutes of game time in a 30-17 win over the Seahawks at raucous U.S. Bank Stadium. Cousins has been, to be blunt, one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL through three weeks. "" It's been a different Kirk ,"" wide receiver Adam Thielen said. ""He's just locked in and on time, he's trusting it."" Credit is due, both to the forever-scrutinized Cousins and Klint Kubiak, a first-year offensive coordinator who has found an instant groove."
2021,4,17,Seattle Seahawks,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Hang an ""Out Of Order"" sign on the Seahawks' defense, because it is currently broken. A week after surrendering 532 yards in an overtime loss to the Titans, Seattle coughed up 453 yards to a Kirk Cousins -led Vikings offense that did pretty much whatever it wanted in a 30-17 win at U.S. Bank Stadium. It was a particularly distressing effort considering the Vikings played the game without Dalvin Cook , their superstar running back, who sat out with an ankle injury. Alexander Mattison stepped in and matched a career high with 112 yards running behind a line that bullied the Seahawks up front. ""We got to get this s--- together,"" Seattle CB D.J. Reed said. ""It's just what it is."""
2021,4,18,New Orleans Saints,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 19 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ For a decade and a half, the Saints' greatest strength was obvious: Put the ball in Drew Brees ' hands and let him go to work. The legendary quarterback has moved to the broadcast booth, leaving Sean Payton to find a new identity for the current Saints. In two of the three weeks this season (the first rule of the 2021 New Orleans Saints: don't talk about the Panthers game ), the focal point has been a defense that rattles quarterbacks and sets the tone. We saw that on Sunday, a 28-13 win that featured three Mac Jones interceptions, including a Malcolm Jenkins pick-six . After an endless road trip prompted by Hurricane Ida, the Saints are ready for a joyful homecoming against the winless Giants ."
2021,4,19,Cincinnati Bengals,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Entering Week 3, only one team had allowed more sacks than the Bengals. This was a terrible trend, especially coming off a 2020 season in which No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow suffered a ghastly knee injury due to faulty blocking. Sunday's 24-10 win over the Steelers was a huge step forward for the team and an offensive line that allowed zero sacks to a Steelers defense that had registered at least one QB takedown in 75 straight regular season games, an NFL record. The Steelers played without their best pass rusher in T.J. Watt , but the Bengals deserve credit for addressing their biggest concern while picking up a huge victory against a division opponent. Cincinnati can build some honest-to-goodness momentum with the winless Jaguars up next on Thursday night ."
2021,4,20,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ We learned just how much T.J. Watt means to the Steelers' defense on Sunday. Pittsburgh entered its matchup against the Bengals with a sack in an NFL-record 75 straight regular season games. As Watt watched from the sideline with an injured groin, the Steelers' streak was unceremoniously halted by a pedestrian Cincinnati line that had struggled to keep Joe Burrow upright a week before against the Bears . While the defense sputtered, the offense remained stuck in neutral. This was particularly apparent on an 18-play, 88-yard, nine-minute drive that ended with a field goal in the fourth quarter. Pittsburgh was still down 24-10 after the Chris Boswell kick, with a chunk of the second half now lost for good. The Steelers have big problems on offense with no easy solutions."
2021,4,21,Miami Dolphins,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Dolphins fought to the bitter end in a 31-28 overtime loss to the Raiders, and they deserve credit for fighting back in a game that appeared to have slipped away when Vegas reeled off 25 unanswered points to take an 11-point lead early in the fourth quarter. A lot of the credit has to go to Jacoby Brissett , who has followed in the footsteps of Ryan Fitzpatrick as the rock-solid backup who will keep the Dolphins from disaster while Tua Tagovailoa recuperates from broken ribs. Not enough teams put the proper value on a No. 2 QB -- the Dolphins seem to get it. The schedule softens over the next month, but a Week 4 game against the winless Colts profiles close to a must-win."
2021,4,22,Philadelphia Eagles,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Eagles will not enjoy watching film of a dispiriting 41-21 beatdown at the hands of the Cowboys on Monday night. The Philadelphia offense never got in gear, the defense gave up too many big plays, and a general air of sloppiness permeated the air for an Eagles team that was flagged 13 times for 86 yards. A defensive touchdown early and garbage-time score late made the final tally slightly more respectable, but the Eagles need to get better on both sides of the ball if they want to stay in the NFC East race. The road ahead is foreboding: Over the next four weeks, Philly gets last season's Super Bowl teams (the Chiefs and Bucs) and two undefeated squads (Panthers and Raiders). Buckle up."
2021,4,23,New England Patriots,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 15 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Patriots were the NFL's gold standard for so long that it's almost jarring to see how ordinary Bill Belichick's team has become. New England authored no flashbacks to former glories on Sunday, a listless 28-13 loss to the Saints that featured three Mac Jones interceptions. This uneasy period of self-reflection comes at an awkward time for the organization: Tom Brady makes his return to Gillette Stadium on Sunday night with a great chance to set the NFL's all-time passing-yardage mark . Brady continues to cast a huge shadow over the organization -- this week is going to feel like a total eclipse. ""The Patriots have done nothing but win for a long time,"" Jones said after losing to New Orleans. ""We have to get back to that."" The rookie has opted into a world of impossible expectations."
2021,4,24,Washington Football Team,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Washington Football Team is one gift-wrapped victory from the Giants away from an 0-3 start, and the failure of the defense to meet expectations is the main reason why. Washington surrendered points on seven of Buffaloâs first nine possessions on Sunday, as Josh Allen picked apart the secondary without being sacked once in a 43-21 loss in Orchard Park. The Bills scored 27 points in the first half; Allen was over 300 yards passing with nine minutes to play in the third quarter. Washington has time to sort things out, but the teamâs primary strength has turned into its biggest weakness. Said Ron Rivera: âWe got a long way to go.â"
2021,4,25,Atlanta Falcons,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 29 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Matt Ryan and the Falcons' offense has been extremely uneven to start the season, but the Atlanta attack perked up in the final quarter of Sundayâs 17-14 comeback win over the Giants at MetLife Stadium. Ryan engineered a 72-yard touchdown drive to draw the Falcons even, then connected on big gainers to Cordarrelle Patterson and Kyle Pitts to set up Younghoe Koo âs game-winning 40-yard field goal as time expired. Kooâs boot officially put Arthur Smith in the win column as an NFL head coach, and now the Falcons have a chance to reset their season with Washington and the Jets on tap in the next two weeks."
2021,4,26,Indianapolis Colts,0-3,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ If you're starting to feel like this is a lost season for the Colts, we're right there with you. Indy remains winless after a 25-16 loss to the rival Titans in Nashville. Carson Wentz showed grit playing on two bad ankles, but his lack of mobility is just another obstacle for a Colts offense that has to work way too hard to move the football. Wentz's miss on an end zone throw to Michael Pittman in the third quarter will stick with him during long hours in the trainer's room this week. The Colts need a win over the Dolphins to save their season in Week 4 and they might have to do it without All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson , who suffered an ankle injury against the Titans."
2021,4,27,Detroit Lions,0-3,"Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ âThese fans can smell win No. 1 on the year!â CBS play-by-play man Greg Gumbel was just stating the obvious, but it all felt like a cruel jinx after Justin Tucker kicked a 66-yard field goal to hand the Lions one of the most ridiculous losses in franchise history (this is really saying something). The absurd finish spoiled an otherwise excellent fourth quarter by the Lions, who sandwiched a Lamar Jackson interception with two scoring drives that put them ahead with 64 seconds to play. But on the Ravens' final possession, Jackson moved Baltimore just inside Detroit territory, while officials appeared to miss a crucial delay of game call before Tucker made history . Impossible."
2021,4,28,Houston Texans,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Texans feel like the AFCâs answer to the Lions: A talent-deficient roster that fights hard for its coach but ultimately lacks the firepower to keep up. Houston struggled to limit chunk gains from a Sam Darnold -led Panthers offense that played without Christian McCaffrey for most of the game, while the Texans' ground attack was practically non-existent in a 24-9 loss in prime time. Davis Mills had moments in his NFL starting debut -- most of them during Houstonâs lone touchdown march late in the first half -- but heâs a third-string rookie quarterback whoâs been pressed into duty before heâs ready. The kid needs help, and Mark Ingram , Phillip Lindsay and the rest of the Texans' run game couldnât give it to him on Thursday night."
2021,4,29,Chicago Bears,1-2,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Matt Nagy era reached its nadir on Sunday. The Bears allowed rookie quarterback Justin Fields to be sacked nine times in a 26-6 loss to the Browns that featured one of the more uninspired offensive performances in recent memory. Jason Peters had no chance against Myles Garrett (4.5 sacks), as the Chicago offensive line gave Fields no opportunity to find his rhythm in a difficult environment. The defense was unable to cover for the offense, surrendering more than 5 yards per carry without forcing a turnover. Fields deserves another chance this week against the winless Lions, but Matt Nagy wouldnât commit to any QB on Monday. This coaching staff cannot get out of its own way."
2021,4,30,New York Giants,0-3,"Previous rank: No. 27 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ You cannot let the Falcons come into your building and beat you on Eli Manning Day . It just canât happen -- and Joe Judge is going to start feeling some heat if he canât start producing some better results. New York is all sorts of beat up right now -- Sterling Shepherd and Darius Slayton both exited with hamstring injuries on Sunday, while linebacker Blake Martinez tore his ACL -- but the Giants let a deeply flawed Falcons team steal a road win by failing to make the big play in the fourth quarter. ( Iâm looking at you, Adoree' Jackson. ) An 0-3 start doesnât spell certain doom in the middling NFC East , but the Giants are a team trending in the wrong direction."
2021,4,31,Jacksonville Jaguars,0-3,"Previous rank: No. 32 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jaguars have now lost 18 straight games, but at least Jamal Agnew guaranteed himself a prominent place in the 2021 team video with his 109-yard field-goal attempt return for a touchdown on the final play of the first half against the Cardinals . Things went downhill from there for the Jaguars, who remain very much a team under construction in the early stages of the Urban Meyer era. To wit: On Monday, the team traded cornerback C.J. Henderson and a 2022 fifth-round pick to the Panthers for tight end Dan Arnold and a 2022 third-round selection. That's not exactly a great return on investment for the ninth overall pick in last year's draft, but it's pretty obvious that in Meyer's world, there were no Jacksonville Jaguars until he took the job. Hard reboot."
2021,4,32,New York Jets,0-3,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 30 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jets are 0-3 for the third consecutive season, and itâs a bad 0-3. Sundayâs shutout loss to the Broncos was filled with penalties, drops, blown assignments and turnovers. The result was a non-competitive performance that reflects badly on new head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas, who should start taking some heat for his construction of a Jets team thatâs lost 17 of 19 games under his stewardship. Zach Wilson was far from good in his third start, but he received virtually no help from Jets teammates who werenât ready for Denverâs intensity. In defense of Wilson and the offense, the schedule dealt them three of the best defenses in football to start the season. The Titans should present something of a respite, but nothing can be assumed in Gotham these days."
2021,5,1,Arizona Cardinals,4-0,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ That right there was a certified, no-doubt-about-it, oh-helllllll-yes, Statement Winâ¢. The Cardinals went to Los Angeles and laid the smackdown on a Rams team that spent the week being hyped up as a Super Bowl favorite (we may have played a small role in this space ). What made the 37-20 triumph especially impressive was that it wasn't all about a dynamo performance by Kyler Murray , though the rising third-year quarterback was again excellent. Instead, this was a team effort: The offense had its way with the Rams' elite defense, while the Cards' defense forced two early turnovers and kept the Matthew Stafford -led Rams air attack out of sync all afternoon. The victory was the first for the Cardinals in nine tries against Sean McVay's Rams. Said cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. : ""I feel like, as a team, we're building towards something."""
2021,5,2,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bucs landed more than an iconic quarterback with an unmatched rÃ©sumÃ© when they signed Tom Brady a year ago in March. Tampa Bay also received a generous supply of Brady Magic, that invisible pixie dust that pushed Nick Folk 's go-ahead field goal attempt into the left upright to secure Tampa's 19-17 win over the Patriots. Brady didn't throw a touchdown in his much-ballyhooed return to Foxborough, while Mac Jones -- his true successor in New England -- completed 19 consecutive passes at one point. But Brady led the Bucs to the go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter, then watched from the sideline as Bill Belichick's gamble on Folk came up snake eyes. Brady's had dozens of ""special"" wins in his career -- we imagine this one is up there."
2021,5,3,Buffalo Bills,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bills are absolutely humming on defense right now. This was extremely bad news for young Davis Mills , the third-round Texans rookie QB who threw four interceptions and led the Houston offense to just over 100 yards in a 40-0 Buffalo victory at Orchard Park. The Texans aren't near the Bills' weight class, but great teams flex their muscles against the league's have-nots, which is exactly what we saw on Sunday. This coming Sunday, we'll get a major, prime-time showdown with the Chiefs -- a rematch of last season's AFC Championship Game ... and possibly a preview of this season's AFC Championship Game. The Bills can only hope they'll have star linebacker Matt Milano , who exited in the first half on Sunday with a hamstring injury."
2021,5,4,Green Bay Packers,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Aaron Rodgers enjoyed victories big and small on Sunday against the Steelers. The reigning MVP steered the Packers to a relatively stress-free 27-17 win at Lambeau in a game that featured a huge contribution from Randall Cobb , the veteran wideout Rodgers single-handedly brought back to Green Bay during the QB's infamous summer of discontent. Cobb was a non-factor in Green Bay's first three games, but he busted out against Pittsburgh with five catches for 69 yards and two touchdowns. Rodgers said prior to the season that he deserved a say in how the Packers build a roster around him; Cobb made his old friend look Ken Jennings-level smart on Sunday."
2021,5,5,Baltimore Ravens,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Ravens knew what they needed on the final play Sunday. With their streak of 100-yard rushing games in jeopardy, Lamar Jackson took the snap and shuffled to his left before sliding down for a 5-yard gain. The rush put Baltimore over the century mark and tied an NFL record -- and more importantly, capped a decisive victory over the previously undefeated Broncos in Denver. Jackson threw for more than 300 yards for just the second time in his career, while Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown atoned for his disastrous Week 3 with a gorgeous diving touchdown catch . The defense took it home: Don ""Wink"" Martindale's group allowed just 254 yards of offense. It can take time, but the Ravens always seem to figure it out on that side of the ball."
2021,5,6,Dallas Cowboys,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 14 The explosive Cowboys offense has garnered much of the headlines in the early going, but the biggest breakout star is playing on the other side of the ball. Cornerback Trevon Diggs is up to five interceptions on the season after two Sam Darnold picks helped produce 10 Dallas points in a 36-28 win over the Panthers at Jerrah World. The 23-year-old became the first Cowboy since the merger to record an interception in each of the first four games of a season. Carolina got back into the game in the fourth quarter -- a portion of the contest Diggs watched from the sideline with what the team termed ""tightness in his back."" The young playmaker's presence on the field has quickly become essential."
2021,5,7,Los Angeles Chargers,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ After the Chargers finished off the Raiders to move into a three-way tie atop the AFC West, they received a high compliment from an unlikely source. ""They're going to go places this year,"" Raiders coach Jon Gruden told the assembled media at SoFi Stadium after the Bolts' 28-14 win . ""They're going to be a force to be dealt with."" Justin Herbert delivered another star turn with three touchdown passes, but the QB didn't do it alone. Los Angeles got huge performances from running back Austin Ekeler (145 total yards, 2 TDs) and the entire defense, which held the Raiders to season lows in production across the board. Fill up that stadium, Chargers fans!"
2021,5,8,Kansas City Chiefs,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Chiefs still have their issues. Their defense was unable to force so much as a single punt against the Eagles . And yet, they have Patrick Mahomes and the brilliant offensive mind of Andy Reid to cover up the blemishes. Kansas City had seven possessions on Sunday; one ended with a Mahomes interception and the rest with the Chiefs celebrating in the end zone. Mahomes threw five touchdown passes, the first a Skee-Ball ""Only Mahomes"" toss to Clyde Edwards-Helaire , the final a 44-yard bomb to Tyreek Hill , who was straight uncoverable all day. After the game, Reid received a commemorative game ball for becoming the first head coach in NFL history to win 100 games with two different teams. Big Red forever."
2021,5,9,Los Angeles Rams,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Let the events of Sunday serve as a reminder to the Rams: If you don't bring your ""A"" game in the NFC West, you have the potential to get embarrassed. That's what happened in a 37-20 loss to the Cardinals at SoFi Stadium, a game that made the good vibes of the Rams' pristine September feel like they came years ago. Two early turnovers -- one a Matthew Stafford interception , the other a fumble by Sony Michel that set Arizona up near the red zone -- were turned into Cardinals touchdowns, while Stafford and his receivers struggled to find a groove. The normally reliable defense has also encountered turbulence, surrendering 911 yards and 61 points in the past two weeks. The Rams need to adjust on the fly with the Seahawks up next on Thursday night ."
2021,5,10,Cleveland Browns,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ When the Browns' defense dominated the Bears in Week 3, it felt such a mismatch of personnel and scheme that it was difficult to distill signs of actual progress. Sunday's 14-7 win over the Vikings was different: Cleveland went into a hostile environment and shut down an opposing offense that had been humming as well as any unit in football in the season's first three weeks. All the Browns need now is balance. Baker Mayfield completed less than half his passes in one of his worst performances in recent memory. Mayfield has always been a streaky quarterback, but he was a liability on Sunday. Cleveland will continue to win games with a stingy defense and elite running game, but Mayfield must improve to make the Browns true Super Bowl contenders."
2021,5,11,Las Vegas Raiders,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Raiders have been slow starters all season, and on Monday night , they dug a hole they were unable to climb out of. Playing in front of a sellout crowd made up mostly of Silver & Black fans in Los Angeles, the Raiders spotted the Chargers 21 points before finally getting on the board in the third quarter. A Derek Carr touchdown pass to Darren Waller brought Vegas within a touchdown, but the Bolts pulled away late to grab a share of the AFC West lead. The Raiders' offense was humbled for the first time, setting season lows in points, total yards and first downs in the loss. ""We cannot come out and take that many punches in the first round,"" Jon Gruden said after the game. ""That was ridiculous."""
2021,5,12,Seattle Seahawks,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 17 ""We don't lose three in a row around here."" Those were the words of left tackle Duane Brown after the Seahawks delivered their best all-around performance of the season in a 28-21 win over the 49ers at Levi's Stadium. Russell Wilson accounted for three touchdowns, while the Seattle defense -- so thoroughly outclassed in Minnesota a week earlier -- shut down the San Francisco attack in an important NFC West showdown. There was some good fortune mixed in. Niners QB Jimmy Garoppolo exited at halftime with a calf injury , and San Francisco kicker Robbie Gould was scratched moments before kickoff with a groin issue, but the Seahawks showed up ready to play and got the job done. For the record, Seattle hasn't had a three-game losing streak in 10 years."
2021,5,13,San Francisco 49ers,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 7 Jimmy Garoppolo is dealing with yet another injury, this time a calf contusion, and Kyle Shanahan will once again spend the week fielding questions about the quarterback position. Trey Lance delivered an uneven performance in Sunday's loss to the Seahawks, but his athleticism and playmaking ability might be San Francisco's best shot, with a showdown against Kyler Murray and the high-flying Cardinals up next . The Niners' offense seems stuck in a rut with Garoppolo behind center -- that remained the case in Jimmy G's two quarters against a Seattle defense that was hemorrhaging yardage and points before Sunday. If Shanahan decides now is the time to pull the trigger and move to the kid, the decision will be justified."
2021,5,14,Carolina Panthers,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Panthers took their first loss of the season because of a disastrous third quarter in Dallas. Carolina went into the tunnel up 14-13 at the half, but was outscored 20-0 over the next 15 minutes of game time. The Cowboys' defense rattled Sam Darnold by shifting to a blitz-heavy scheme that produced a long field-goal miss, a three-and-out, then back-to-back Trevon Diggs interceptions. Darnold and the offense did well to battle back in the fourth quarter with two touchdown drives, but Dallas successfully ran out the clock with its power running game. One brutal quarter aside, the Panthers acquitted themselves well against a high-quality opponent. No need to panic."
2021,5,15,Cincinnati Bengals,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Bengals have a share of first place in the AFC North, and Joe Burrow very much looks like The Franchise. The second-year quarterback picked apart the Jaguars in a 24-21 win , showing poise and presence as he led the Bengals to four consecutive scoring drives in the second half of a comeback victory. Burrow is averaging 9.2 yards per attempt (third in the NFL among qualified passers), and he's getting much better protection: Cincinnati has allowed just one sack in the past two weeks after surrendering 10 in the season's first two games. If the Bengals keep their young star upright, something special could be brewing in the Queen City."
2021,5,16,Denver Broncos,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Sunday's showing against the Ravens is unlikely to convince doubters that Denver's perfect September was more about who the Broncos are than who they played. They were unable to stop Lamar Jackson through the air, and the offense couldn't get anything going in a dispiriting 23-7 loss at Mile High. Teddy Bridgewater struggled to move the offense before exiting the game with a concussion; Drew Lock took over in the second half and was unable to produce a single point as Broncos fans jeered. ""It's extremely disappointing,"" safety Justin Simmons said. ""We knew how important this was, especially being able to come back home and play a team like Baltimore. We knew what the stakes were for it, and it's just disappointing."""
2021,5,17,Minnesota Vikings,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ It was so easy for Kirk Cousins and Co. in the first three weeks. On Sunday, that trend seemed destined to continue when the Vikings marched straight down the field for a touchdown in their opening drive against the Browns. Then the script flipped. Minnesota had 11 possessions from that point onward and never scored again in a disappointing 14-7 loss at U.S. Bank Stadium. Cousins was knocked out of his groove by a consistent Cleveland pass rush, and Dalvin Cook spent more time on the sidelines with that ominous ankle issue. The Vikings still feel like they have the DNA of a playoff team, but a 1-3 start puts them in a difficult position. They won't find the postseason if they can't find consistency."
2021,5,18,Tennessee Titans,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Titans played without A.J. Brown and Julio Jones on Sunday, but you can't hang a painful loss to the previously winless Jets solely on the banged-up wide receiver corps. The offensive line failed to adequately protect Ryan Tannehill , the back end of Tennessee's defense was victimized by Zach Wilson on multiple deep strikes and Randy Bullock missed the potential game-tying field-goal try in overtime in a 27-24 loss. At 2-2, the Titans know they have stars at running back and quarterback. After that, things are way too dicey for Mike Vrabel's team. ""We're just frustrated because we got our tails whupped,"" safety Kevin Byard said after the game. ""It's consistency with us."""
2021,5,19,New Orleans Saints,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 18 Who are the Saints? That's a fair question to ask after a 2-2 start in which New Orleans has alternated looking like a legit contender and a conference also-ran. We got a little bit of both on Sunday against the Giants : The Saints jumped out to a 21-10 lead behind a pair of Taysom Hill touchdown runs, but the offense went cold as the defense faltered in crunch time. New Orleans surrendered 11 unanswered points to close the fourth quarter, then allowed the Giants to march down the field for the winning touchdown on the first drive of overtime. Playing in front of a sold-out home crowd at the Superdome for the first time in 637 days , the final result couldn't be considered anything less than an epic letdown."
2021,5,20,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 20 Beating the Packers at Lambeau Field requires a precision performance by the offense. The Steelers couldn't deliver that on Sunday, and they'll take a three-game losing streak into Week 5 as a result. The running game remains non-existent in Matt Canada's offense, and Ben Roethlisberger and his receivers aren't doing enough. On Sunday, Roethlisberger and JuJu Smith-Schuster left points on the field with failures to connect on two pass plays that should have gone for scores. Roethlisberger could have been more accurate on the throws, while Smith-Schuster could have helped his QB by flashing the playmaking ability that marked his first two seasons in Pittsburgh. The attack is not as dynamic as it needs to be, and it's made the Steelers a middling team."
2021,5,21,Indianapolis Colts,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 26 It's a start. The Colts went down to Miami for a must-win Week 4 contest and got the job done with a 27-17 victory over the Dolphins. Indy was the superior team in all three phases and got breakout games from Jonathan Taylor (103 yards, TD) and tight end Mo Alie-Cox (two touchdowns). Carson Wentz displayed improved mobility two weeks removed from his double ankle sprain, providing hope that Indy can dig itself out of an 0-3 hole. It helps that the Colts play in the AFC South: As Indy found its way into the win column on Sunday, the Titans were falling on their face against the Jets. The division remains there for the taking ... Who wants it?"
2021,5,22,New England Patriots,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 23 The irony is that Bill Belichick would never have settled for that 56-yard field-goal try in steady rainfall if Tom Brady was still his quarterback. Mac Jones had played an extremely efficient game to that point, but gaining Belichick's trust in game-deciding moments remains a work in progress. So, facing fourth-and-3 from the Bucs' 37, Belichick instead sent out Nick Folk , who clanked the ball off the left upright in a 19-17 loss to the defending champions. It was a difficult ending to an evening in which the Pats' defense didn't surrender a touchdown pass to Brady and held Tampa Bay to its lowest point total of the season. Still, Brady's team found a way at Foxborough. The same old story ... with a twist."
2021,5,23,Washington Football Team,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 24 With each passing week, Taylor Heinicke builds the case that he deserves the starting quarterback job, regardless of Ryan Fitzpatrick 's availability. Heinicke led Washington on back-to-back touchdown drives in the fourth quarter on Sunday, turning a 30-22 deficit into a 34-30 win over the Falcons in Atlanta. He ended the day with 290 yards passing while leading the Football Team to scores on four of their five second-half possessions. With the Washington defense continuing its surprising disappearing act (where have you gone, Young & Sweaty ?), Heinicke is being asked to keep his team's season afloat. So far, so good."
2021,5,24,New York Giants,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 30 When the Giants selected Saquon Barkley and Daniel Jones in back-to-back drafts, the plan was for the pair of top-10 picks to lead Big Blue for years to come. A disappointing 2020 season brought complications to that plan, but the duo performed like young stars in a stunning 27-21 road win over the Saints. Jones threw for a career-high 402 yards and commanded the offense with confidence, while Barkley scored two touchdowns, including the game-winner in overtime, and looked very much like the player who dominated the league for stretches before suffering a torn ACL last September. The Giants put themselves in a deep hole with their 0-3 start, but a closer look under the hood shows a team with the ability to get hot."
2021,5,25,Philadelphia Eagles,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Eagles rolled up over 450 yards of offense on the Chiefs and never had to send their punter on the field. It was another promising effort by the offense, but also another game filled with unforced errors that doomed Philly to its third straight loss . The Eagles had three touchdowns taken off the board by penalties in drives that eventually ended with field goals. Longtime NFL personnel man Mike Lombardi calls these instances ""four-point plays"" for the number of points you leave on the field by trading a touchdown/PAT for a field goal. The math ain't pretty: The Eagles had three ""four-point plays"" on Sunday in a game they lost by 12. Nick Sirianni's team needs to clean it up. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿"
2021,5,26,Miami Dolphins,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ This was supposed to be the season Miami put it all together and became a power player in the AFC. Four games into the season, the only thing remarkable about this team is how mediocre it is. The Dolphins welcomed a winless Colts team into their building on Sunday and were thoroughly outplayed in all phases of a 27-17 defeat . The Fins, losers of three straight since their season-opening win in Foxborough , have been outscored 62-17 in two home losses. Up next is a daunting road matchup against Tom Brady and the defending champion Bucs. If it's not crisis time in Miami, it's getting close to it."
2021,5,27,Atlanta Falcons,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ The Falcons were all set up. They were in their building and in possession of a 30-22 lead over the Washington Football Team with less than 10 minutes to play. If they closed the game out, they'd head to London with the chance to move above .500 with a win over the rebuilding Jets. Unfortunately for the Falcons, the end was as grim as it gets: Atlanta's defense surrendered two touchdowns with the offense unable to answer back in a 34-30 loss . ""We had multiple opportunities to win that game and we didn't,"" said Falcons coach Arthur Smith, who might age like a sitting U.S. president this season. ""... We have to get a lot of things fixed in a hurry."""
2021,5,28,New York Jets,1-3,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 32 Zach Wilson made several throws to excite the Jets and their fanbase in Sundayâs 27-24 overtime win over the Titans at MetLife Stadium, but one stood out above the rest: With the game tied at 17 in the fourth quarter, Wilson rolled to his right on a naked bootleg and spotted Corey Davis downfield. Wilson, seeing that the Titansâ deep safety had drifted out of position, motioned to his wide receiver to go deep, then delivered a perfect strike for a 53-yard touchdown . The play showed off Wilsonâs improvisational skill and next-level arm talent, and instantly refilled the well of Jets fan optimism that had dried up over three losses to start the season. Said Robert Saleh of his young QB: ""I think he was awesome.â"
2021,5,29,Chicago Bears,2-2,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 29 Week 4 brought undeniable progress for the Bears and their beleaguered offense. Chicago scored on David Montgomery touchdown runs in each of its first two possessions en route to a 24-14 win over the woeful Lions. Justin Fields was better in his second career start, and the offensive line did a much better job protecting the rookie QB (funny how that works when itâs not Myles Garrett and Jadeveon Clowney screaming around the edges). Also notable was a schematic shift for the Bears, who saw offensive coordinator Bill Lazor take over play-calling duties to positive results. Matt Nagy didnât seem thrilled to talk about the switch after the win, but Chicagoâs offense is probably better off with the head coach out of the captainâs chair."
2021,5,30,Jacksonville Jaguars,0-4,"Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ï»¿ Urban Meyer called Thursdayâs nightâs 24-21 overtime loss to the Bengals âdevastatingâ and âheartbreaking.â You get it: Meyer isnât used to losing, and heâs now dropped four consecutive games for the first time in a head-coaching career that dates back to 2001. The Jaguars coughed up 14-0 and 21-14 leads in Cincinnati, but Jacksonville played a much more competitive brand of football than we saw over the seasonâs first three weeks. Monday brought needless drama, as Meyer was forced to address a viral video that showed a woman dancing close to his lap in a Columbus, Ohio, bar. ""I just apologized to the team and staff for being a distraction,"" Meyer said."
2021,5,31,Detroit Lions,0-4,"Previous rank: No. 27 The hits keep on coming for the Lions. Linebacker Romeo Okwara , Detroitâs most important player on defense, is done for the year after tearing his Achilles tendon in Sundayâs 24-14 loss to the Bears. Itâs the same devastating injury that ended the season of 2020 first-round pick Jeff Okudah back in Week 1. Itâs all crushing news for a Lions team that had one of the thinnest rosters in football to begin the season. With attrition setting in, Detroitâs talent disparity is compounded. Now Detroit's the lone remaining winless team in the NFC, and itâs on head coach Dan Campbell to keep the Lions from losing hope."
2021,5,32,Houston Texans,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Texans showed fight in the first three weeks, even managing a win in the season opener against the Jaguars. Sundayâs 40-0 loss to the Bills makes you wonder how many more times David Culleyâs team will taste victory before the season is through. The Texans need Tyrod Taylor back in the worst way: Rookie Davis Mills simply isnât ready to face top NFL competition, a reality laid bare in a nightmarish performance against the Bills that produced as many interceptions as passing first downs (four each). Of course, the Texansâ struggles run deeper than the kid under center. âYou could put Joe Montana out there today, and the way we played, you're not going to have any success on offense,â Culley said ."
2021,6,1,Buffalo Bills,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 Defeating the Chiefs in October and defeating them in January are two very different beasts, but that doesn't mean Sunday night's 38-20 stomping of the defending conference champs wasn't important. For the Bills, it was affirmation of what they already believed: With superstar quarterback Josh Allen out front, they can beat anyone. They might even embarrass you. That's what happened at Arrowhead Stadium, where Patrick Mahomes struggled to find any rhythm against a Buffalo defense that played like it knew what was coming. Bills defenders might tell you they did, which is a credit to Sean McDermott and his entire coaching staff. Buffalo is a juggernaut."
2021,6,2,Arizona Cardinals,5-0,"Previous rank: No. 1 Kyler Murray , Kliff Kingsbury and the offense get much of the headlines coming out of Arizona, but it was the Cardinals' defense that took the NFC West leaders to 5-0. The Cards held Trey Lance to 10 points in his NFL starting debut and stopped the 49ers on four of their five fourth-down attempts in a 17-10 win . The most dramatic of those stuffs came in the second quarter, when Lance scrambled toward the right pylon before slamming into a wall comprised of brick ( Tanner Vallejo ) and mortar ( Isaiah Simmons ). After the game, DeAndre Hopkins called it ""championship football."" Lance would probably describe it a different way."
2021,6,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 The weirdest stat of Week 5: Sunday's 45-17 win over the Dolphins marked the first time Tom Brady threw for more than 400 yards and five touchdowns in a game. This feels impossible, given Brady's unmatched rÃ©sumÃ© over 22 seasons, but it's true. Not bad production, considering Brady didn't even play the final nine minutes of regulation as Blaine Gabbert closed out an overmatched Miami team. At halftime, newly acquired veteran cornerback Richard Sherman approached teammate Leonard Fournette and shared the eye-opening opinion that he'd never been part of a team with so much talent. The running back's response? ""This s***'s different."""
2021,6,4,Dallas Cowboys,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 The Cowboys swept their three-game homestand against the Eagles, Panthers and Giants by a combined score of 121-69 -- a stretch of dominance that cements America's Team as a force to be reckoned with in the NFC. On Sunday , the Cowboys rolled up 515 yards of total offense on a bruised-and-battered Giants team that -- like the Eagles and Washington -- knows the best-case scenario is scrambling for a wild-card spot come December. If Dallas keeps its health, the NFC East race is already over. The next question: How good can the Cowboys be? As we approach mid-October, they cut the profile of a legitimate Super Bowl contender."
2021,6,5,Los Angeles Chargers,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Justin Herbert Is A Savage In The Pocket. The second-year prodigy was an unstoppable force against the Browns, throwing for 398 yards with five total scores in a 47-42 win at Hollywood Park. The Bolts' usually reliable defense stumbled through its worst performance of the season, but Herbert was there to pick up the slack with his cadre of playmakers. L.A.'s 26 points in the final period were the most by a team in a fourth quarter in eight years. ""To win a game like this that turns into a track meet, you have to have a superstar quarterback,"" coach Brandon Staley said after the victory. ""And that's what he is."" You know what else he is? (Please see first sentence.)"
2021,6,6,Green Bay Packers,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 The Packers love Mason Crosby . He's been a dependable contributor for years, and he's always weathered the storms of inconsistency that grip all kickers not named Justin Tucker . After Crosby missed his third field goal in less than an hour on Sunday against the Bengals, Matt LaFleur decided to check in on his grizzled veteran. ""I could see the look in his eyes,"" the coach said. ""There was zero flinch from him."" Given one more shot to salvage his afternoon, Crosby split the uprights to lift the Packers to an overtime conquest over the Bengals, the team's fourth consecutive win. ""I went up to him and just told him I loved him,"" running back Aaron Jones said after the win. ""You'll always stay with your teammates no matter what."""
2021,6,7,Baltimore Ravens,,"Previous rank: No. 5 Lamar Jackson reminded the world on Monday night that he is one of one. The Ravens' quarterback authored the greatest passing game of his career, carving up the Colts for 442 yards and four touchdowns in a ridiculous comeback win . The Ravens fell behind 22-3 early and were trailing by 16 points in the fourth quarter before ripping off the final 22 points of the game. The comeback included two Mark Andrews touchdowns and, ridiculously, two Mark Andrews two-point conversions. When the Ravens won the overtime coin toss, the game was already over. Jackson marched Baltimore through an exhausted Indy defense for 68 yards on 10 plays, ending with the Hollywood Brown game-winner . It was a brilliant comeback that just might have been Jackson's best performance yet."
2021,6,8,Los Angeles Rams,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 9 Welcome back to the offense, Robert Woods . The veteran wide receiver is one of the Rams' top weapons, but forming a connection with Matthew Stafford was more difficult than expected in the season's first four weeks. That changed against the Seahawks on Thursday night, when Woods turned a whopping 14 targets into 12 catches for 150 yards in a 26-17 win over their division rivals. The Los Angeles passing attack is imposing when Cooper Kupp , DeSean Jackson and Tyler Higbee are on the field at the same. Add Woods' reliable presence into the mix, and it can be overwhelming."
2021,6,9,Cleveland Browns,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 10 In wins over the Bears and Vikings , the Browns authored two of the most dominant defensive performances we've seen by any team all season. On Sunday, Cleveland's D entered The Twilight Zone . Kevin Stefanski's team surrendered 493 total yards -- and 26 points in the fourth quarter alone -- in a 47-42 insta-classic loss to the Chargers. Disappointing outcome aside, the Browns' beat-up defense should recover, while a huge bounce-back performance from Baker Mayfield and the offense offered promise of better days. If these Browns can put both sides of their game plan together, they'll be tough to stop."
2021,6,10,Kansas City Chiefs,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 Following a humbling blowout loss at home on Sunday Night Football , you can imagine the Chiefs wondering aloud -- to borrow a Madden-ism -- where that truck came from. The 18-wheeler in question was Josh Allen , Micah Hyde and the rest of a Buffalo Bills team that put Kansas City on notice: You may be the back-to-back defending conference champion, but you're not the best team in the AFC. The truth is, it's not close right now. The Chiefs have been mistake-prone on offense and overmatched on defense, facts the Bills laid bare. ""You kind of have to take it on the chin,"" Patrick Mahomes said. ""We've still got a long season left, but this one you're going to remember."""
2021,6,11,New Orleans Saints,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Saints might be the NFL's most perplexing team through five weeks, but a surge of reinforcements could bring some more clarity (and consistency) to Sean Payton's squad. Wide receivers Michael Thomas and Tre'Quan Smith , kicker Wil Lutz , left tackle Terron Armstead and center Erik McCoy are all eligible to return to action following the Week 6 bye. Defensive tackle David Onyemata is eligible to return from suspension following Week 7's matchup against the Seahawks. That's a long list of valuable players, and it's a credit to these Saints that they managed to get to their well-timed bye above .500. No team can survive in the NFL without roster depth. The 2021 Saints just proved they have it."
2021,6,12,Tennessee Titans,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 18 The Big Dog is still The Big Dog. Any attempts to fade The Big Dog will result in the stern reminder that The Big Dog is not to be disrespected under any circumstances. Derrick Henry rushed for 159 yards and three touchdowns, another mighty performance in a 37-19 win over the lowly Jaguars. Henry is on pace to set the NFL record for carries and rushing yards this season, and it's hard to imagine an otherwise ordinary Titans team turning away from the one thing that makes it special. This stat, from CBS : Henry just completed the most productive 40-game stretch by a running back in NFL history. His 4,792 yards over the span is just ahead of Jim Brown (4,759). Jim Brown."
2021,6,13,Cincinnati Bengals,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 15 Evan McPherson 's NFL career is off to a promising start, but he'll have to do some special things to escape being remembered as The Kicker Who Celebrated Too Soon . The rookie's overtime field-goal attempt against the Packers started straight before veering left and making contact with the flapping orange flag blowing atop the left upright. McPherson thought he'd converted his third game-winning kick in five professional contests, but instead it was a miss that set up an eventual 25-22 loss . McPherson later said he thought the officials were ""playing a game"" with him. That would have been a pretty mean-spirited prank, to be honest."
2021,6,14,Carolina Panthers,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 14 Christian McCaffrey returned to practice last week -- now the Panthers need their superstar RB back on Sundays. The Carolina offense sputtered again in a frustrating loss to the Eagles that featured three Sam Darnold interceptions and pass-protection issues that we didn't see before No. 22 exited with a hamstring injury in Week 3. Such is the importance of McCaffrey, a driving force in both the running and passing games. He seems especially essential to Darnold, whose turnover-prone ways have returned without his safety valve sliding out of the backfield. ""Sam needs to take what's given him,"" Matt Rhule said. ""If we do that, we'll get back on track quickly."""
2021,6,15,Minnesota Vikings,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 17 No Dalvin Cook ? No problem! That was the general sentiment -- perhaps not behind the scenes at Vikings headquarters -- but around the team as it prepared for the winless Lions on Sunday. Naturally, Minnesota found itself in a street fight against Dan Campbell's scrappy group, which pushed the Vikings to the brink before the kicker saved the day. Greg Joseph hit four of five kicks, including the 54-yarder as time expired in a 19-17 win over Detroit. It was a redemptive moment for Joseph, whose miss from 37 yards out cost the Vikings a win over the Cardinals in Week 2 . Still, concerns linger over an offense that looked all but unstoppable in the season's first three weeks. Is it a simple slump, or a sign of bigger issues?"
2021,6,16,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ Progress. The Steelers desperately needed to show signs of it on offense in Week 5, and that's exactly what they did. Ben Roethlisberger threw for 253 yards and two scores, and Najee Harris produced like the first-round pick he is in a 27-19 win over the Broncos . It wasn't all good news for the offense, however: JuJu Smith-Schuster 's season is over after he suffered a shoulder injury that will require surgery. Pittsburgh has a good group of playmakers at wide receiver, but Smith-Schuster was a treasured safety valve in the slot for a veteran quarterback who loves to get the ball out quickly when the pass rush closes in (and even when it doesn't)."
2021,6,17,San Francisco 49ers,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 13 Trey Lance brought some much-appreciated excitement to the offense in his first career start. Points? That was a different story. Lance threw one interception and the Niners were stuffed on four of their five attempts on fourth down, the difference in a 17-10 loss to the undefeated Cardinals. Lance looked very much like a raw rookie at times on Sunday, but he also moved San Francisco into Arizona territory on eight occasions and led the team with 89 rushing yards. It felt like something to build off of, but Kyle Shanahan appears determined to turn back to Jimmy Garoppolo if the veteran is ready to return from a calf injury after the Week 6 bye, and Lance is now dealing with a knee sprain that that will be re-evaluated at the end of the week."
2021,6,18,Las Vegas Raiders,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 In 2018, the Raiders gave Jon Gruden a 10-year, $100 million contract with the hope he would guide the franchise back to the promised land. Instead, Gruden resigned on Monday after three seasons and five games following reports that emails he wrote over a seven-year span included racist, misogynistic and homophobic comments. Gruden's sudden downfall is one of the biggest bombshells in franchise history. More than just the head coach, Gruden was the face of the franchise and driving architect behind the team's construction. Interim coach Rich Bisaccia has been tasked with keeping the 2021 season from slipping away under extraordinary circumstances. As for who fills the massive power vacuum in Vegas? The Raiders are probably asking themselves the same question."
2021,6,19,Denver Broncos,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ Inefficiency in the red zone plagued Teddy Bridgewater during his one season with the Panthers. You could make the case that Bridgewater, not Sam Darnold , would still be Matt Rhule's QB in Charlotte had he not made so many backbreaking mistakes near the goal line. Fast-forward to the present day, and Bridgewater has brought this problem to Denver. Facing an eight-point deficit in the final minute on Sunday , the Broncos failed in four cracks from inside the Pittsburgh 10. The final play was the clincher, a poorly thrown ball picked off by the Steelers with 11 seconds to play. In these crucible moments, Teddy simply needs to be better."
2021,6,20,Philadelphia Eagles,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Eagles were in desperate need of a big play late in Sunday's matchup against the Panthers. They got one in each phase of the game during the final five minutes of a 21-18 win . T.J. Edwards ' blocked punt , Jalen Hurts ' 6-yard touchdown run and a Steven Nelson interception of Sam Darnold turned a five-point deficit into a three-point victory that snapped a three-game losing streak. Next up for the Eagles is a huge measuring-stick game against the reigning champion Bucs on Thursday night . It will take more than a strong finish to beat Tampa Bay."
2021,6,21,Seattle Seahawks,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ The Good Ship Carroll is taking on water. The Seahawks fell to 2-3 with a home loss to the division-rival Rams , then learned that Russell Wilson could miss at least a few games after undergoing surgery on the finger he injured in Thursday's game at Lumen Field. The Seahawks are a team searching for an identity: Pete Carroll loves to run the football and ride with his defense, but the rushing attack is average and the defense is in the conversation for the league's worst. Wilson is the one who has always held it together -- take Seattle's superstar quarterback out of the mix and there's nothing left to hold onto."
2021,6,22,New England Patriots,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ Generally speaking, a scenario that combines a rookie QB making his fifth start and an offensive line missing four starters is -- well -- not ideal. It's the stuff blowout losses are made of, and perhaps that would have been the Patriots' fate had they not been playing the hapless Texans on Sunday. But perhaps not, considering Mac Jones is showing us on a weekly basis that he's not your typical rookie quarterback. Jones engineered a pair of fourth-quarter scoring marches on Sunday, including his first classified as a game-winning drive, in a 25-22 win . Jones isn't as flashy as the other rookie QBs, but on balance, he's been the most impressive."
2021,6,23,Chicago Bears,3-2,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 29 The identity of the Justin Fields Bears -- in 2021, anyway -- is beginning to take shape. Run the football (a lot), ask your young QB to protect the football and make a few plays, then let the defense take it home. That was a formula for success against the Raiders in a convincing 20-9 win at Allegiant Stadium. Chicago proved it could move the ball on the ground even without David Montgomery (knee), getting a combined 139 yards on 34 rushes from Damien Williams and Khalil Herbert . Will the Bearsâ formula work against the NFLâs elite? Imposing tests lie ahead with the Packers and Bucs up next."
2021,6,24,Indianapolis Colts,,"Previous rank: No. 21 As the Ravens celebrated their stunning overtime win over the Colts , ESPN cut to a replay of Carson Wentz on the sideline reacting to the game-winning touchdown by Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown moments earlier. Wentz anxiously rubbed his hand through his hair, clearly stunned by what had just transpired. A 25-9 fourth-quarter lead had turned into a 31-25 defeat. The biggest win of the season had morphed grotesquely into one of the most crushing defeats in recent franchise history. A collapse like this has many fathers: There were multiple breakdowns on special teams, while a gassed defense offered zero resistance against a rampaging Lamar Jackson . It was a game the Colts absolutely could not lose ... and yet, they did."
2021,6,25,Atlanta Falcons,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 27 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Falcons flew high over London thanks to a vintage performance by Matt Ryan . The veteran signal-caller might not be able to sling the ball like he did five years ago, but he showed against the Jets that he can still pick apart a young and inexperienced defense with surgical precision. It helps to have a stud like Kyle Pitts around. With Calvin Ridley out , the No. 4 overall pick finally enjoyed the breakout game many had been waiting for; Pitts went off, hauling in nine catches for 119 yards and his first career touchdown against a New York defense ill-equipped to handle his rare combination of size and speed. Pittsâ special skill set deserves a Darren Waller -level target share."
2021,6,26,Washington Football Team,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 23 Is there a more disappointing defense in football than Washington's this year? Ron Riveraâs D made progress in pass-rushing and takeaways against the Saints, but the inability to stop big plays continued to haunt the Football Team in a 33-22 loss . On Sunday, Washington allowed a 72-yard touchdown to Deonte Harris and a Hail Mary score to Marquez Callaway at the end of the first half. After the game, Washington players said they didnât see the end zone heave coming , which, hoo boy. Said Rivera : âIâm very frustrated, because we have too many good football players to not be better than what we are right now.â"
2021,6,27,New York Giants,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 24 Week 5 was a disaster for the Giants. Daniel Jones (concussion), Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Kenny Golladay (knee) were all lost to injury as the superior Cowboys coasted to a 44-20 win at Jerrah World. It was a sobering game for Big Blue, which entered Sunday feeling great about a season turnaround after a big comeback win in New Orleans . Now begins a week of health updates : Barkley and Golladay are expected to miss Week 6, while Jones needs to clear the leagueâs concussion protocol. Rookie Kadarius Toney , who had a breakout game on Sunday (10 catches, 189 yards) before getting ejected for throwing a punch , is also banged up (lower leg), but his ailment doesn't sound too significant. With a brutal schedule ahead, Joe Judgeâs team is in serious danger of second-half irrelevance ."
2021,6,28,Miami Dolphins,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Dolphins will get on the plane to London wondering what they are: A good team in a bad slump or a bad team in a long season. Facing the Bucs' gang of All-Pros and future Hall of Famers presents a tough assignment for anyone, but Sunday's 45-17 loss to the defending champions wasnât the type of performance to engender hope that a turnaround is near. Miami allowed 558 yards of total offense, including 411 passing yards and five touchdowns to Tom Brady , the legendary quarterback who is still finding ways to torture the Dolphins fan base from the beyond the AFC East grave."
2021,6,29,Detroit Lions,0-5,"Previous rank: No. 31 Dan Campbell isnât one to hide his emotions, so it wasnât a surprise when the Lions coach got emotional after his teamâs latest heartbreaking loss . Detroit is 0-5, with two of its defeats coming on last-second field-goals that bordered on the impossible. This one was made more painful because the Lions had orchestrated a stunning comeback to take a late lead over the Vikings. It still wasnât enough. ""You want it for yourself, as an organization and for all of us,â Campbell said with tears in his eyes. âBut you want it for those players. Theyâre out there busting their ass and â¦ itâs tough.â"
2021,6,30,Houston Texans,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 32 Davis Mills shredded the Patriots' defense in the way many expected Tom Brady to a week earlier. The third-round rookie washed away the memory of his four-INT Week 4 performance , setting career highs in passing yards (312) and touchdown passes (3) in a narrow 25-22 loss . Davisâ productive day was especially impressive considering Bill Belichickâs typical mastery over rookie quarterbacks as New England's head coach: The Hooded One moved to 22-6 against first-year QBs, but this one wasnât a laugher like many of the others. The only Texan player seeing ghosts on this day was Ka'imi Fairbairn , who missed a field goal and two PATs. Kaânt do that."
2021,6,31,New York Jets,1-4,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 28 The Jets mysteriously lost their momentum somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean before landing in London, delivering a deeply lackluster performance in a 27-20 loss to the Falcons at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Robert Saleh hits the bye week with more holes to plug than fingers on his two hands: The defense is coming up empty in the gameâs most important moments, while rookie quarterback Zach Wilson is back to square one after another shaky showing. Saleh and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur need to find ways to get Wilson more comfortable, especially early in games. One idea: Make a point to get highly drafted young playmakers like Elijah Moore and Denzel Mims involved. It shouldnât be this hard."
2021,6,32,Jacksonville Jaguars,0-5,"Previous rank: No. 30 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The losses continue to pile up while Urban Meyer continues to give Shad Khan buyerâs remorse on a biblical scale. After another lopsided defeat, this time to the Titans , the Jaguars have lost 20 consecutive games. They havenât won since last yearâs season opener , and theyâre the first team to lose 20 in a row since 1977. That team, Tampa Bay, was an expansion franchise. Jacksonville hasnât been able to lean on that excuse for 26 years. ""You can't wrap your head around that,"" running back James Robinson said of The Streak . ""We've got to find a way to win.â"
2021,7,1,Arizona Cardinals,6-0,"Previous rank: No. 2 Kliff Kingsbury's positive COVID-19 test kept him from the sidelines on Sunday, but the view from the couch had to be sweet. With the rest of the Arizona coaching staff pitching in to cover for their absent head coach, the Cardinals went to Cleveland and beat up on the Browns in a decisive 37-14 win . This was a quintessential team victory: Arizona piled up five sacks and forced Baker Mayfield into three turnovers, while Kyler Murray threw four touchdown passes, two of them to DeAndre Hopkins . The Cardinals are 6-0 for the first time since 1974 and have shown they can beat their opponents in numerous ways. None of this feels like a fluke."
2021,7,2,Buffalo Bills,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 Sean McDermott might receive criticism for his decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 rather than kick the chip-shot field goal late in the closing seconds against the Titans, but he wonât deserve it. The coaches who matter in todayâs NFL eschew conservative decision-making in favor of trust in their best players. On Monday night, with the game hanging in the balance, McDermott put his faith in Josh Allen to secure the win. The disastrous outcome -- Buffaloâs offensive line was compromised by Titans bodies and Allen lost his footing short of the marker -- is unfortunate, but the Bills likely went to the locker room knowing thatâs a game they win nine out of 10 times."
2021,7,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 The Bucs toyed with the Eagles on Thursday night . Playing their third game in 12 days, they built a 28-7 lead through three quarters and held Philadelphia's offense to 99 yards to that point. When the Eagles made things interesting with a fourth-quarter score, Tom Brady coolly jogged back on the field and removed any drama from the proceedings with a 27-yard completion to Antonio Brown on third-and-7 from near midfield with less than four minutes to play. Game over. A slew of injuries aside, the Bucs are off to a very strong start in their title defense."
2021,7,4,Dallas Cowboys,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 Dak Prescott would not be denied. He helped keep the Cowboys in business with a clutch 24-yard completion to CeeDee Lamb in the final seconds of regulation, then connected with Lamb again on the 35-yard touchdown in overtime to seal a 35-29 win over the Patriots in Foxborough. Prescott limped to the locker room with a strained calf that will get plenty of treatment during Dallas' bye week. Prior to the heroics from Prescott and Lamb, Trevon Diggs continued the incredible start to his season with his seventh interception, a pick-six of Mac Jones late in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys are a big-play team."
2021,7,5,Baltimore Ravens,,"Previous rank: No. 7 On Sunday, Lamar Jackson threw for just 167 yards with two interceptions and only managed 51 yards on the ground. Typically, this type of output means bad news for the Ravens. Typically. In Week 6, Baltimore humbled the AFC West-leading Chargers in all phases in a 34-6 win . The Ravens blew out one of football's hottest teams with a balanced ground attack that wasn't overly reliant on their quarterback: Baltimore rushed for 187 yards on 38 carries, with Devonta Freeman , Latavius Murray and Le'Veon Bell all reaching pay dirt. The defense did the rest, holding the high-scoring Chargers to 26 rushing yards while limiting L.A. to a 4-for-16 success rate on third and fourth downs. The Ravens are thriving as they enter a surprisingly consequential Week 7 matchup against the Bengals."
2021,7,6,Green Bay Packers,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 Don't let the long hair, laconic demeanor and Hawaiian summers fool you: Aaron Rodgers remains a gnarly competitor with a Jordan-like ability to find motivation that will raise his play. We saw that on Sunday at Soldier Field , when the reigning MVP iced the game with a touchdown scramble, then delivered a pointed message to Bears fans jeering him from the end-zone section. ""All my f---ing life, I own you,"" Rodgers shouted . ""I still own you. I still own you."" His 22-5 record against the Bears stands as the third-best winning percentage (.815) by a QB against a single opponent since 1950, among those with a minimum of 25 starts, according to ESPN Stats & Information ."
2021,7,7,Los Angeles Rams,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 8 Not enough is being made of Cooper Kupp 's fantastic season. The fifth-year wide receiver quickly established himself as an important part of L.A.'s attack after coming into the league as a third-round pick out of Eastern Washington in 2017, but Kupp has made the leap from difference-making starter to superstar in his first season with Matthew Stafford . Kupp went off for nine catches for 130 yards and two touchdowns in a blowout win over the Giants, which led to a mind-boggling stat getting passed around Twitter on Sunday night. In the last 35 years, only two players have had 600-plus yards and at least seven touchdowns through six weeks: Randy Moss ... and Cooper Kupp. Whoa."
2021,7,8,Los Angeles Chargers,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Every team has a bad day. The Chargers hope it doesn't get worse than Sunday's humbling 34-6 loss to the Ravens in which Brandon Staley's team was manhandled on offense, defense and special teams. Justin Herbert was virtually unstoppable in Week 5's shootout win over the Browns, but the Ravens' blitz-heavy scheme kept the second-year star uncomfortable and led to an uncharacteristically inaccurate performance. Even the Chargers' celebrated aggressiveness backfired in this one: Herbert threw a pair of incompletions on two fourth-and-short attempts in Chargers territory, with both turnovers leading to Baltimore points. It's not how they wanted to hit their bye, but the Bolts should still feel optimistic about what's to come."
2021,7,9,Kansas City Chiefs,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 10 For two quarters on Sunday, the Chiefs looked as lost as ever. The turnover epidemic was only intensifying, with three in the first half -- including perhaps the ugliest single play in Patrick Mahomes ' career. They were clearly pressing, but they didn't panic. Kansas City came out of the tunnel and dominated, shutting out Washington on defense, while Mahomes authored the cleanest half of the season, completing 19 of his 24 attempts for 175 yards and two touchdowns without a turnover, ultimately producing a 31-13 win . A comfortable blowout was just what this team needed, but the Chiefs know they must put together complete games to truly turn their season around."
2021,7,10,Tennessee Titans,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Titans might not be perfect, but theyâre battle-tested and completely unafraid of the moment. On Monday night, Mike Vrabelâs team went toe-to-toe with the Bills and never blinked: Derrick Henry rushed for 143 yards and three touchdowns before the defense sent the sold-out crowd in Nashville into hysterics with a goal-line stand that will go down in franchise lore. Ryan Tannehill made his share of money throws down the stretch, but Tennessee doesnât sniff victory without another ferocious performance by The Big Dog -- who just might be the greatest running back of his generation. Said Vrabel after the win: ""We feel like we can beat anybody in the league.â"
2021,7,11,Cincinnati Bengals,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 13 For years, it was the Bengals who were the dreadful team that seemingly existed to serve as a soft landing spot in the schedule for contenders. It was almost jarring to watch a game in which Cincinnati was on the other side of that dynamic; Zac Taylor's team went into Ford Field and outclassed the Lions in a 34-11 win . Joe Burrow tied a career high with three touchdown passes and once again electrified the Bengals' attack with deep strikes to rookie sensation Ja'Marr Chase . Every elite offense has its own version of the Big 3. The Bengals' trio of Burrow, Chase and running back Joe Mixon offers enough firepower to overwhelm the opposition. Week 7 brings a huge measuring-stick game against the Ravens."
2021,7,12,New Orleans Saints,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 In the wake of a Week 6 bye, it feels like a good time for a check-in: How are we feeling about the Jameis Winston Experiment? Statistically, the veteran quarterback has been solid, throwing for nearly 900 yards with 12 touchdowns and just three interceptions during the Saints' 3-2 start. Of course, a closer study of the game tape reveals hints that the Winston of New Orleans is the same Winston who ran himself out of Tampa Bay. His usage -- topping 23 pass attempts in just one game so far -- tells you Sean Payton is loath to give his QB too much responsibility. We're a hard HOLD on this one."
2021,7,13,Cleveland Browns,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 It's tough to find any positives to take out of Sunday. The Browns weren't particularly competitive in the 37-14 loss ; the team's last flicker of relevance came on a gorgeous Hail Mary heave by Baker Mayfield on the final play of the first half. It was all downhill from there for Mayfield, who accounted for three turnovers and aggravated his left shoulder injury enough to put his Thursday night availability against the Broncos in question . Cleveland also lost running back Kareem Hunt , who is expected to be sidelined 4-6 weeks by a calf injury. A disappointing .500 team through six weeks, the Browns are beat up and in danger of falling out of the AFC North race."
2021,7,14,Minnesota Vikings,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Vikings have no idea how to play a normal game. For the second straight week, Mike Zimmer's team blew a two-score lead in the final minutes against an inferior opponent, and for the second straight week, Minnesota managed to survive an epic near-collapse. Greg Joseph set off a celebration with a long field goal in Week 5; on Sunday, it was Kirk Cousins ' 27-yard dime to K.J. Osborn to seal a 34-28 overtime win over the Panthers. The Vikings are strange. They feel like a team that can beat anyone ... or lose to anyone. As such, 3-3 feels about right heading into their bye. Minnesota is inconsistent, maddening ... and intriguing."
2021,7,15,Las Vegas Raiders,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 18 Coming off the week from hell , Las Vegas had every excuse to pull a no-show on Sunday at Mile High. Instead, the Raiders delivered their most impressive all-around performance of the season in a 34-24 whooping of the Broncos. Interim coach Rich Bisaccia had the team ready on both sides of the ball: The Vegas defensive line battered Teddy Bridgewater all day, while Derek Carr continued to make sweet music with Henry Ruggs and his underrated collection of playmakers. After the game, Carr made a point to give credit to offensive coordinator Greg Olson, who pushed all the right buttons in his first game as play-caller in place of Jon Gruden. ""I thought (Olson) crushed it,"" Carr said."
2021,7,16,Pittsburgh Steelers,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ There are no words to properly describe how important T.J. Watt is to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He is the teamâs best and most impactful player, and his ability to raise his game in the most crucial of moments makes him one of the greats. We saw that again on Sunday night, a 23-20 overtime win over the Seahawks that featured a dominant Watt performance capped by the Geno Smith strip-sack that set up the game-winning field goal by Chris Boswell . A closer study of the play reveals its brilliance: Watt was playing the run, reacted to Smithâs play-action, fought through several blockers and drilled Smith just as the quarterback thought he had escaped the pocket. Watt is what happens when elite talent meets max effort."
2021,7,17,San Francisco 49ers,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 17 The bye came at an ideal time for the Niners, who stumbled into their off week on a three-game losing streak. The offense needs to achieve consistency, and San Francisco could find it by addressing two big issues: 1) Who is the quarterback going forward? 2) Who can stay healthy and serve as a catalyst in the running game? First-round pick Trey Lance is a player who can be a solution to both those questions, but he's dealing with a knee issue and doesn't appear to have earned Kyle Shanahan's trust just yet. It might be time for the coach to make a leap of faith."
2021,7,18,Indianapolis Colts,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Colts buried the pain of Week 5's Monday night collapse and took out their aggression on the poor Texans, who were pummeled in Indy's 31-3 win at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts rode to victory on impact performances by their best players. Carson Wentz played within himself and connected on downfield throws like he was on the 2017 Eagles. Jonathan Taylor continued his recent rampage with a monster outing that included two touchdowns and an 83-yard run . Then there's linebacker Darius Leonard , who was a menace to Davis Mills and the Texans all afternoon, causing fumbles , snagging interceptions and wreaking havoc for four quarters. Playing the Texans can make anyone look good, but the Colts look like a team on the rise."
2021,7,19,Carolina Panthers,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Panthers appear to have a Sam Darnold problem. Darnold showed promise during Carolina's 3-0 start, but the absence of Christian McCaffrey has coincided with an extended stretch of rough play by the fourth-year QB. Darnold deserves credit for leading the Panthers to 11 unanswered points to force overtime in Sunday's loss to the Vikings, but he was deeply ineffective before those final two drives. Darnold threw an interception , lost a fumble and didn't cross 100 yards passing until the 6:30 mark of the fourth quarter. On Monday, Matt Rhule acknowledged Darnold needed to be better and declared the Panthers' days as an air-it-out offense are over. ""We're going to redefine who we are,"" he said. ""That's the only way we can win."" Yikes."
2021,7,20,Denver Broncos,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 19 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Broncos' 3-0 start was built on the backs of some of the worst teams in football. Three weeks later, Denver is 3-3 and looking like the definition of average. Sunday's loss was the most troubling yet, as a Raiders team awash in turmoil shut out the outside noise and outclassed the Broncos in every phase of the game. Some garbage-time production from Teddy Bridgewater couldn't cover up another inefficient offensive performance that included three interceptions, five sacks and too many missed opportunities. The defense struggled, as well, giving up big-play strikes to Derek Carr while rarely getting hands on the Raiders QB. Said safety Justin Simmons : ""Simply put, we got our butts whooped."""
2021,7,21,New England Patriots,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Patriots gave the Cowboys all they could handle, but it still wasn't enough to keep New England from suffering its fourth consecutive loss at Gillette Stadium. Mac Jones (again impressive) put the Pats in position for a dramatic win with a 75-yard touchdown strike to Kendrick Bourne late in the fourth quarter, but the defense surrendered a game-tying field goal with 20 seconds to play in regulation, then allowed CeeDee Lamb to get behind the secondary on the game-ending 35-yard touchdown in overtime . ""We went toe-to-toe with them for 60 minutes,"" Bill Belichick said. ""They just made a few more plays than we did."" This is an organization not accustomed to moral victories."
2021,7,22,Seattle Seahawks,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Seahawks needed Geno Smith to do something special in a virtual must-win scenario in Week 6. Everything about that sentence is absurd, and perhaps it shouldnât surprise you to learn that Geno wasnât the guy to save a season. Smithâs overtime fumble on a T.J. Watt strip-sack -- the second Smith turnover in as many weeks with the game hanging in the balance -- was the difference in a crushing 23-20 loss to the Steelers at Heinz Field. Geno's game-ending INT against the Rams in Week 5 could be explained away by a receiver who slipped, but Sundayâs fumble was the product of a backup quarterback failing to feel the best player on the field closing hard to his right. Calamity ensues."
2021,7,23,Chicago Bears,3-3,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 23 Not enough offense. It's been a common lament around the Bears for -- well, pretty much forever, it feels like. And it was the easiest way to explain another loss to Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. Chicago actually got out of the gates quickly with a Justin Fields -led scoring drive to start the game, but the Bill Lazor attack went cold after that. When a Darnell Mooney touchdown catch pulled the Bears within a field goal in the fourth quarter, Rodgers marched the Packers 75 yards on seven plays for the clinching touchdown -- capped with a viral moment that left Bears fans praying the rocky Rodgers/Packers marriage disintegrates in totality after this season."
2021,7,24,Philadelphia Eagles,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Jalen Hurts continues to fill up the fantasy stat sheet, but the jury remains very much out on whether the second-year QB should be a permanent fixture for the Eagles under center. Perfunctory cosmetic scores aside, Hurts struggled to lead the offense for much of Thursday nightâs 28-22 loss to the Bucs. The Eagles' attack -- which abandoned the running game against Tampa Bayâs top-ranked rushing D -- put the team in a deep hole in a first-half performance that featured four three-and-outs and one interception . The problem -- and this is more on rookie coach Nick Sirianni than on his young QB -- is that Philadelphia is far too dependent on Hurts on a weekly basis. Itâs time to find some balance."
2021,7,25,Atlanta Falcons,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Kyle Pitts enjoyed his long-awaited breakout game in Week 5 against the Jets -- now comes the time for Arthur Smith to get his rookie tight end sensation humming at the same time as Atlantaâs already established receiving star. Through four games (he missed the Falcons' fifth game due to a personal issue), Calvin Ridley has turned 42 targets into just 27 catches for 255 yards and one touchdown. With Julio Jones gone, the Falcons' offense needs Ridley to play at the elite level he established in 2020. Pittsâ rise can only help Ridley get his season into gear."
2021,7,26,Washington Football Team,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 26 Things started beautifully on the afternoon Sean Taylorâs No. 21 was retired at FedExField: Washingtonâs defense stepped up and forced three first-half turnovers, including two Patrick Mahomes interceptions. Taylor Heinicke had a pretty touchdown connection to Ricky Seals-Jones , and the Football Team took a lead into the tunnel after two quarters. It all went to hell from there: Washingtonâs offense was shut out in the second half, while Mahomes recalibrated himself and guided the Chiefs to a blowout win . Washington entered the season as a defending division champion with a path to improvement. Instead, the Football Team feels like a conference also-ran by mid-October."
2021,7,27,New York Giants,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 27 The injury-depleted Giants needed to play a nearly perfect game to beat a superior Rams team on Sunday. Instead, Big Blue had two costly turnovers deep in its own territory during a nightmare second quarter that featured 28 unanswered points by the visitors. By the end of the game, an unsightly 38-11 loss , Daniel Jones had fumbled twice (losing one) and thrown three interceptions. Jonesâ supporting cast is compromised at the moment -- practice squad call-up Dante Pettis was targeted 11 times! -- but the QBâs failure to protect the ball is worrisome after a promising start to the season in that department. The Giants are 1-5 for the second straight year with a difficult schedule ahead."
2021,7,28,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 32 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jaguars badly needed something good to happen to their season. Thanks to a kicker who was signed to the practice squad late last month, Jacksonville snapped a 20-game losing skid and hit the bye with some much-needed optimism. The hero was Matthew Wright , whose 53-yard field goal as time expired gave the Jags a 23-20 victory over the Dolphins in London. It was the performance of a lifetime for Wright, who drilled a 54-yarder to tie the game earlier in the fourth quarter. ""I think he was telling me he was like a software engineer like a month and a half ago,"" Trevor Lawrence said. ""... Just crazy, you can't even make it up."""
2021,7,29,Miami Dolphins,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Dolphins had what many considered a layup in Week 6: A trip to London and a matchup against a winless Jaguars team that appeared rudderless under Urban Meyer. And despite a successful return to action for Tua Tagovailoa , Miami coughed up a double-digit lead, made some dreadful in-game management decisions and somehow were left to watch the Jaguars celebrate a walk-off win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. A season that started with so much promise now seems nearly lost. ""I'm not doing a good enough job,"" coach Brian Flores said in his postgame press conference. ""Not playing consistently enough. Not coaching well enough. Not playing well enough. ... Consistent ball -- first half, a little bit in the second half, but we're just not putting it together. That starts with me."""
2021,7,30,New York Jets,1-4,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ The Jets had multiple issues to work out during their bye week, but none is bigger than their immense problem with slow starts on offense. New York is five games into the season and has managed a single touchdown in the first half. Last week in London , Matt Ryan and the Falcons had piled up 14 first downs before Zach Wilson and the Jets managed one. This ongoing struggle is putting too much stress on a defense that has appeared gassed by the fourth quarter. Robert Saleh hired Mike LaFleur, in part, because the first-year offensive coordinator runs a Kyle Shanahan offense that's supposed to be friendly to young QBs. Can it be friendlier?"
2021,7,31,Detroit Lions,0-6,"Previous rank: No. 29 Jared Goff isnât the only reason why the Lions are the last winless team in the NFL, but the veteran quarterback obviously left his head coach wanting in the aftermath of a 34-11 loss to the Bengals. âI will say this ... I feel like he needs to step up more than he has,â Dan Campbell said . âI think he needs to help us. Just like everybody else.â Campbellâs long pause during that reply seemed to last forever -- the coach was obviously trying to measure his words, knowing any criticism of a starting QB will be amplified. Goff felt like something of a sacrificial lamb when the Lions traded for him ... and thatâs exactly how itâs playing out."
2021,7,32,Houston Texans,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Texans have lost five straight, they were outscored 71-3 in their last two road games, and generally look like the worst team in football. We knew David Culley had a challenging job ahead of him when he was named head coach, but this is starting to feel like an impossible test now that the season has taken shape and you see how thoroughly Houston is outmanned on a weekly basis. Having a third-round rookie taking every snap only amplifies the challenge that faces the coaching staff, but the idea of turning back to veteran Tyrod Taylor once he returns from his hamstring injury -- which could be very soon -- feels counterintuitive for a team playing for tomorrow. Where will the next win come from?"
2021,8,1,Arizona Cardinals,7-0,"Previous rank: No. 1 With their marquee matchup against the Packers days away, the schedule makers did the Cardinals a favor with a nice tune-up against the worst team in football. Arizona took care of business against Houston in a game that showcased the Cards' newest weapon . Zach Ertz recorded a 47-yard touchdown catch , a career-long score that showed the tight end still has some juice in his legs. Last year, Kliff Kingsbury's offense too often felt like it was Kyler -to- Nuk or bust. Now, Arizona is getting contributions from Hopkins, yes, but also A.J. Green , Rondale Moore , Christian Kirk ... and Ertz, a former Super Bowl hero who looks like a man with something to prove."
2021,8,2,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 Bucs stars come at you in waves. The Bears were lucky enough to miss Rob Gronkowski (ribs) and Antonio Brown (ankle) on Sunday, but they still had to contend with Mike Evans (three touchdowns), Chris Godwin (111 yards, TD) and the running game (182 yards and a score) in a 38-3 Tampa Bay romp . Tom Brady didn't even play a particularly good game by his lofty standards, but the G.O.A.T. still tossed four touchdowns without an interception, becoming the first quarterback to throw 600 TD passes in NFL history. The champs are humming, with a key division matchup against the Saints on deck."
2021,8,3,Buffalo Bills,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 2 When Josh Allen was stuffed on fourth-and-short to clinch a frustrating 34-31 loss to the Titans in Week 6, it put the spotlight on a perplexing issue concerning the AFC East leaders: Why is this loaded offense struggling to tally touchdowns in the red zone? Buffalo is scoring nearly 34 points per game, but the team is 26th in red-zone TD conversion. No team in football made more trips inside the opponent's 20-yard line in the season's first six weeks, but the Bills punched it into the end zone only 55.2 percent of the time. That's down from the 62 percent clip Buffalo posted in its gangbusters 2020 rampage through the league. One can assume this issue was thoroughly investigated during the bye week."
2021,8,4,Dallas Cowboys,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ Life was good for the 5-1 Cowboys as they reached their Week 7 bye, even if Dak Prescott 's calf injury presents an ominous cloud above The Star. Prescott suffered the injury on the final play of Dallas' Week 6 overtime win over the Patriots, and despite positive reports , ongoing concern is warranted. The Cowboys are essentially playing without a safety net: The team's backup behind Prescott is none other than ... checks notes ... Cooper Rush , the 27-year-old undrafted free agent who has completed one pass (for 2 yards) in five professional seasons. Considering the nature of Prescott's season-ending injury in 2020, should the Cowboys have made a greater effort to retain Andy Dalton in the offseason? Were Prescott to have a setback, could Dalton return before the trade deadline?"
2021,8,5,Los Angeles Rams,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 Sean McVay was staring down a nightmare postgame press conference -- until his biggest defensive stars rode in to save the day. With the Lions driving for the lead late in the fourth quarter, Aaron Donald crashed through the offensive line and forced an early throw from old friend Jared Goff , who was picked off by Jalen Ramsey to seal a 28-19 win at Hollywood Park. Before that play, McVay had watched his Rams struggle to put away a winless Lions team that was completely fearless in its game strategy. Detroit successfully executed a surprise onside kick and two fake punts , but Los Angeles still found a way, thanks to Donald and Ramsey. Having a team of plucky fighters is good ... being in possession of superstars is better."
2021,8,6,Green Bay Packers,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 The Packers have now won six straight since their ugly Week 1 defeat to Saints , but this still doesn't feel like a team firing on all cylinders. Green Bay was badly outgained by a middling Washington squad that could have scored one of the biggest upsets of the season had it executed better in the red zone. The Packers deserve credit for getting those big stops in close, of course, but Matt LaFleur's group will need to be better when the competition stiffens. That comes Thursday with a road matchup against the undefeated Cardinals -- a challenge that becomes far more imposing if Davante Adams ( reserve/COVID-19 list ) is unable to suit up."
2021,8,7,Cincinnati Bengals,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 That right there was a Statement Winâ¢. The Bengals rolled into Baltimore and sent thousands of once-confident Ravens fans at M&T Bank Stadium streaming to the exits by the fourth quarter of a 41-17 triumph that makes us reconsider everything in the AFC North. Cincinnati has moved into a tie with Baltimore atop the division. and none of this feels unsustainable, with Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase producing at historic levels together. From the NFL Research team: Chase (35/754/6) has the most receiving yards by any player through his first seven career games in NFL history. It's still not too late to delete your ""They should have taken Penei Sewell !"" takes on social media. Scrub away! Save your Smart Football Internet Person reputation!"
2021,8,8,Baltimore Ravens,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 5 The Ravens hit their bye at 5-2, a strong record good enough for a tie atop the AFC North. Given the injury epidemic in Baltimore, this feels something close to a best-case scenario. But the nature of Sunday's loss to the Bengals -- a 41-17 shellacking at home -- is sure to prompt difficult questions at team headquarters. Are the Ravens, with their depth concerns and inconsistencies, quietly vulnerable in a division that suddenly houses a rising power in Western Ohio? The Ravens were badly outscored and outgained by the Bengals -- Cincinnati was the more physical team, as well. The off week began with a wake-up call. Or was it a warning siren?"
2021,8,9,Los Angeles Chargers,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 8 OK, so Justin Herbert stunk up the joint two Sundays ago in Baltimore , as did the rest of his Chargers teammates in a game to forget. The question becomes this: Was it simply a bad week -- or do teams now have a playbook on how to stop the Bolts? The Chargers' offense could use improvement in early-down situations. More work is needed on the defensive side, which is surprising, considering Brandon Staley's pedigree upon taking this head-coaching job. Los Angeles ranked 19th in defensive DVOA heading into Monday Night Football and is one of the worst teams in football against the run. The Chargers are good -- potentially great -- but they remain under construction."
2021,8,10,Tennessee Titans,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 10 Just over three weeks ago, the Titans were embarrassed by the Jets , and the AFC South looked like a division that would produce a sub-.500 champion. Cut to late Sunday afternoon: Over seven days, Mike Vrabel's team knocked off the Bills and Chiefs -- both participants in January's AFC Championship Game. Ryan Tannehill , Derrick Henry and A.J. Brown once again paced the offense in Week 7, while Harold Landry led a Tennessee defense that made Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City's vaunted attack look vulnerable and weak. A win this week in Indianapolis will put the AFC South on lock before the calendar flips to November. Change happens fast in the NFL."
2021,8,11,Las Vegas Raiders,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Bisaccia Bump is real! The Raiders improved to 2-0 since Rich Bisaccia took over as interim coach , and you can argue that Las Vegas' best two games of the season -- their most complete efforts, anyway -- have come with Jon Gruden sitting on a couch in parts unknown. Derek Carr was simply brilliant against the Eagles, completing 31 of 34 passes for 323 yards and two touchdowns. The quarterback's dominance was even more impressive considering star tight end Darren Waller was scratched before the game with knee and ankle issues. The MVP field is lousy with superstars having career years, but Carr absolutely deserves to be in the conversation right now. He's been one of the best players in the league."
2021,8,12,New Orleans Saints,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 Drew Brees sat in with Peyton and Eli on ESPNâs Manningcast on Monday night, and you could tell the Saints legend was struggling to find the words as we watched the ever-erratic Jameis Winston run Brees' old offense at Lumen Field. Winston wasnât great, but luckily he had Alvin Kamara to carry the load. Kamara was the best player on the field, finishing with 10 catches, 179 yards of total offense and a touchdown. The Saints have never been so dependent on their superstar running back -- take him out of the mix and it all falls apart."
2021,8,13,Cleveland Browns,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Browns probably have quality NFL running backs stuck between couch cushions at team headquarters. Third-stringer D'Ernest Johnson stepped up on Thursday night, rushing for 146 yards and a touchdown in a 17-14 win over the Broncos. The shifty back should remain in the mix even when Nick Chubb returns to the lineup. Meanwhile, Case Keenum got the victory in his first start in Cleveland -- could Keenum make the, um, case to stay in the lineup if he thrives in another start? Kevin Stefanski is a big fan of the veteran, a fact undoubtedly on Baker Mayfield 's mind as the starter is sidelined with a seriously fouled-up left shoulder. ( UPDATE: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Friday that Mayfield has been cleared to play and is expected to start vs. Pittsburgh on Sunday.)"
2021,8,14,Kansas City Chiefs,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 9 This was a Sunday of red flags ... and not the kind team personnel race across the field after touchdowns at Arrowhead. The Chiefs were down 24-0 before a pass rusher sniffed Ryan Tannehill . The Patrick Mahomes -led offense didn't convert its first third down until 12:46 remained in the game. And then there was the most somber of all scenes for Chiefs fans: Down 27-3, late in the third quarter and facing fourth-and-forever, Andy Reid sent out Harrison Butker to attempt a 57-yard field goal. Butker, like the rest of the Chiefs on Sunday, didn't come close. There are too many special players involved to count out K.C. -- but this is no longer a case of working out the kinks. The Chiefs have reached a crisis point."
2021,8,15,Minnesota Vikings,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 14 On a recent edition of the Around The NFL Podcast , we probed Vikings beat reporter Arif Hasan on the relationship between Mike Zimmer and Kirk Cousins . The tension between the head coach and starting quarterback seems palpable at times, but Hasan asserted that any frustrations with Cousins as a QB (or teammate) are largely negated by his play. The veteran might not ever inspire lengthy monologues about his leadership abilities, but he stacks numbers, year after year. The production will sneak up on you: In 58 games as Minnesota's starter, Cousins has completed over 69 percent of his 1,805 attempts for 104 touchdowns and just 31 interceptions. His passer rating of 103.9 over that span represents the production of a star. Why don't we see him that way?"
2021,8,16,Indianapolis Colts,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 18 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ They don't play a particularly pretty brand of football, but the Colts don't mind rolling in the mud. We saw that on Sunday night in soggy Santa Clara, where Indianapolis scored a 30-18 win over the 49ers to remain within striking distance of the red-hot Titans in the AFC South. Jonathan Taylor has now gone over 100 scrimmage yards in four straight games, while Carson Wentz made big plays down the stretch -- none bigger than the 28-yard fourth-quarter touchdown strike to Michael Pittman that iced the Niners. A Week 8 showdown with the Titans at Lucas Oil Field will have massive implications in the division."
2021,8,17,Pittsburgh Steelers,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Steelers reached their bye at 3-3 and look like the epitome of the 8-8 team (or 9-8 or 8-9 whatever) as we creep toward November. Rising above mediocrity will take Herculian performances from their best players: Ben Roethlisberger has to be better than a game manager, while T.J. Watt must continue to play like a Defensive Player Of The Year frontrunner. An X-factor is running back Najee Harris , who's come on strong in recent weeks. The first-round rookie leads the team in receptions, is in the top 10 in the league in rushing attempts and has handled his blocking assignments. If Pittsburgh's offensive line gives him more room to operate, he'll leap into the Offensive Rookie Of The Year conversation."
2021,8,18,New England Patriots,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 21 He'll never acknowledge it publicly, but nothing brings Bill Belichick more pure joy than embarrassing the New York Jets. His Patriots did it again on Sunday, pouring it on Robert Saleh's team in a 54-13 win that ended a four-game losing streak at Gillette Stadium. Led by the already ever-steady Mac Jones , the Patriots scored on nine of their 10 possessions, not counting kneel-downs. ""We finally kind of saw a little bit of a result that was good, and we've just got to stick to the formula and stick to the process,"" said Jones, now a fully programmed and operational soldier of Patriot Way."
2021,8,19,San Francisco 49ers,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Kyle Shanahan Defenders Society is always armed with a good excuse or two, and the miserable conditions at Levi's Stadium on Sunday night qualify as solid cover. But it's results that ultimately matter most, and the 49ers are 2-4 and 4.5 games behind the NFC West-leading Cardinals before Halloween. How does Shanahan fix this mess? It probably starts with a change at quarterback, a position the 2021 version of Jimmy Garoppolo seems unable to play at a satisfactory level. After the 30-18 setback to the Colts, Shanahan said he would ""guess"" Garoppolo starts in Week 8, but Jimmy G's continued first-string status is now completely tied to the health of Trey Lance , currently rehabbing a sprained knee."
2021,8,20,Atlanta Falcons,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 25 Matt Ryan and Kyle Pitts are officially a thing. The veteran quarterback and rookie phenom connected repeatedly on Sunday, including on two vital completions to set up Younghoe Koo 's game-winner in a 30-28 victory over the Dolphins in Miami. It's hard to describe how different Pitts is: On the 28-yarder that put Atlanta in field-goal range in the final minutes, Pitts lined up on the outside against Xavien Howard , an All-Pro ballhawk who regularly shuts down No. 1 wideouts. Pitts beat Howard by a half step, then used his size to come down with the catch. Pitts' performance the last two weeks (16/282/1) backs up the pre-draft hype that positioned the former Florida standout as a generational talent."
2021,8,21,Denver Broncos,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 20 To quote the late, great Thomas Earl Petty, the Broncos are free fallin', out into nothin'. The 3-0 start has given way to four consecutive losses and the general sense that Denver is a middling team no closer to serious contention than it was a year ago with Drew Lock behind center. Teddy Bridgewater isn't the sole reason for the Broncos' month-long slump, but he's proving once again that he's simply not a dynamic presence under center. If all the Broncos needed was a game manager, Teddy Two Gloves would be a perfect fit. But with Denver's talented defense not living up to expectations, Vic Fangio needs a difference-maker at QB. Teddy ain't it."
2021,8,22,Seattle Seahawks,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 22 Geno Smith âs first completion in a pivotal Monday Night Football matchup against the Saints went for 84 yards and a touchdown to DK Metcalf . Every Smith completion thereafter combined for 83 yards. Yes, the GenoCoaster was fully operational in a damaging 13-10 loss that leaves the Seahawksâ season perilously close to careening off the rails. Itâs a shame, too, as Seattleâs maligned defense held up well against New Orleans. Now 0-3 at home for the first time since 1992, the Seahawks will need a serious run to make the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years. Get well soon, DangeRuss."

The Bears were outclassed in all facets -- unable to slow down Tom Brady and a parade of Tampa Bay playmakers, while the offense couldn't get out of its own way in a five-turnover showing. Justin Fields was responsible for all five of those giveaways (three INTs and two lost fumbles), but head coach Matt Nagy was right to keep his rookie signal-caller under center for the duration of the blowout. The 2021 Bears are not a Super Bowl contender -- they're not a playoff team, either -- so let Fields get the necessary experience and live with the good, the bad and the (very) ugly."
2021,8,24,New York Giants,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 27 Daniel Jones continues to be an extremely difficult evaluation subject for the Giants. The former first-round pick regularly produces at a mundane level from a counting-stats perspective, but he still passes the eye test as a difference-maker as a passer and runner. Sometimes as a receiver, too: His acrobatic one-handed catch in the third quarter of Sunday's 25-3 win over the Panthers was the biggest highlight of New York's only real touchdown drive of the day. The Giants are a team seemingly headed for a hard reboot, but cutting ties with Jones still feels like a move that could backfire."
2021,8,25,Carolina Panthers,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Panthers will stick with Sam Darnold for now, because Sam Darnold's backup is P.J. Walker , and P.J. Walker isn't playing at Temple anymore. Matt Rhule has boxed himself into a corner: It's becoming apparent he's whiffed on his hand-picked starting QB for the second straight year, and the coach has no escape hatch ... for now, anyway. After Sunday's ugly 25-3 loss to the Giants, reports surfaced that the Panthers are "" evaluating their pursuit of a franchise quarterback ,"" and Carolina is expected to be involved in trade discussions for Deshaun Watson . The legal entanglements of Watson will likely keep him out of action no matter where he's employed at the Nov. 2 trade deadline, but Carolina looks ready to make a major push for another hard-reset QB."
2021,8,26,Philadelphia Eagles,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 24 ï»¿ Loved this stat from NBC Sports Edge ( via John Daigle ): Jalen Hurts has scored 43.4 percent of his fantasy points in the fourth quarter this season. Nobody Cares About Your Fantasy Team, but that data gives us an idea of what's really happening with the Eagles' offense beneath the solid counting stats for the second-year quarterback. This is an offense that regularly sleepwalks through the first three quarters of games before making it respectable in garbage time. The inconsistency of the attack shouldn't be put at the feet of Hurts alone, but would it be entirely shocking if Nick Sirianni turned to newly elevated backup Gardner Minshew to juice Philly's offense when the outcome is still undecided? Hurts doesn't have the draft pedigree or (seemingly) the organizational support to remain the locked-and-loaded QB1."
2021,8,27,Washington Football Team,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ The Football Team outgained the Packers by 126 yards (430-304) and played -- by far -- their best defensive game of the season ... yet still found themselves on the wrong side of a double-digit defeat thanks to two crushing failures in the third quarter. Taylor Heinicke's overturned TD was highway robbery that should be addressed by the Common Sense Police (or, at least the Competition Committee in the offseason), but there was no excuse for the back-to-back fourth-down failures near the goal line that spelled doom at Lambeau Field. There were plenty of positives to take out of Sunday, but there hasn't been a more frustrating loss this season for Ron Rivera's team."
2021,8,28,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 28 Trevor Lawrence hasnât taken the NFL by storm after coming into the league as the most heralded rookie QB since Andrew Luck , but the arrow is definitely pointing up for the No. 1 overall pick. Lawrence made several big plays in leading the Jaguars to their first win of the season two Sundays ago in London , and he has shown steady week-to-week improvement. His gains against an NFL pass rush were evident against the Dolphins: According to Next Gen Stats, Lawrence threw for 117 yards when pressured in Week 6. He had just 276 yards total when under duress in Jacksonvilleâs first five games. The kid can play."
2021,8,29,Miami Dolphins,1-6,"Previous rank: No. 29 The Dolphins suffered another loss in crushing, last-second fashion , and their playoff chances have virtually vanished before the season reaches its midpoint. We now enter Evaluation Time in Miami, and that starts with Tua Tagovailoa . As the uncomfortable Dashuan Watson trade rumors continue to swirl around the organization, Tua put together a solid performance against the Falcons -- his second straight promising showing since coming off the injured list. Yes, there were two gnarly turnovers that factored into the loss, but Tagovailoa has flashed since his return. Do the Dolphins really want to cash out now and get into the Watson business?"
2021,8,30,Detroit Lions,0-7,"Previous rank: No. 31 The Lions arenât talented, but they are gutsy and they play their hearts out every week for Dan Campbell. Jared Goffâs late interception doomed Detroit to another painful loss on Sunday in Los Angeles, but hanging tough for four quarters against a Super Bowl contender like the Rams counts as progress in Detroit. Campbellâs performance was admirable, as well -- the coach called for an early onside kick and two fake punts , with all three trick plays ending with a successful outcome. To have all that go right and still lose is frustrating, but the Lions donât feel like a hopeless 0-7. The losses continue to mount, but the fight remains strong."
2021,8,31,New York Jets,1-5,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 30 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Getting embarrassed by the Patriots isnât a new development for the Jets, but it was at least understandable when Tom Brady was the New England quarterback. Getting lit up by a 54-13 score in the Mac Jones era is a level of dysfunction entering into the realm of the indefensible. It was New Yorkâs most lopsided loss since 2010 and the most points the team had allowed in 42 years. To make matters worse, Zach Wilson exited with a knee injury that will keep him on the shelf for several weeks and necessitated the return of Joe Flacco . Robert Saleh was brought in to change a culture of losing thatâs permeated the franchise for nearly a decade. So far, no good."
2021,8,32,Houston Texans,1-6,"Previous rank: No. 32 Tyrod Taylor returned to practice, but thatâs not the quarterback who will garner headlines around the Texans this week. The trade deadline is next Tuesday, and NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday morning Deshaun Watson is expected to be moved before that date. There appear to be multiple suitors interested in Watson, which goes to show you just how much some NFL teams are willing to overlook if it means landing a Pro Bowl quarterback in his physical prime. Moving Watson now would represent a best-case scenario for the Texans: Theyâd acquire a slew of premium draft picks while unloading the toxicity connected to their former franchise star. A win-win at the highest level."
2021,9,1,Green Bay Packers,7-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 We wouldn't go as far as calling it a miracle win, but what Green Bay did on Thursday night in Arizona was special. Down their top two wide receivers and defensive coordinator Joe Barry, the Packers battled for four quarters against the NFL's lone remaining undefeated team and came out on top. Aaron Rodgers was positively glowing during his postgame interview with FOX's Erin Andrews, and you understood why. Rodgers, for all his offseason grumbling about perceived disrespect in the organization, sees the Packers for who they are: a deep, battle-tested, well-coached team. It's the DNA of Super Bowl champions ... and the Pack have it. ( UPDATE: Aaron Rodgers tested positive for COVID-19 and will not play against the Chiefs on Sunday, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Wednesday.)"
2021,9,2,Dallas Cowboys,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ No matter what happens from this point forward, Cooper Rush will always have Sunday night. The backup QB stepped in for Dak Prescott and made a series of big throws in a 20-16 win over the Vikings in Minneapolis. Dallas' sixth consecutive victory showed how the Cowboys can survive -- in the short-term, anyway -- without their star quarterback, while providing a showcase for just how much their defense has improved in Dan Quinn's first year at the controls. Dallas made Kirk Cousins miserable all night and all but removed Justin Jefferson from the field. The Cowboys used to be a top-heavy operation comprised of stars and scrubs. Not anymore."
2021,9,3,Arizona Cardinals,7-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 Week 8 was a difficult one for the Cardinals: They fell from the ranks of the unbeaten in a frustrating prime-time loss to the shorthanded Packers, then watched their franchise star reportedly exit State Farm Stadium in a walking boot. The longer runway ahead of their next game will obviously help Kyler Murray 's chances of being ready for Sunday's key division matchup against the 49ers, but you wonder if Arizona took notice of the more cautious path of the Cowboys, who opted to give Dak Prescott extra time to heal his calf injury. Being careful with Murray in November could be the key to success in January."
2021,9,4,Buffalo Bills,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 They had to get through a bye week to do it, but the Bills finally got to put Week 6's painful prime-time loss to the Titans in the rearview, courtesy of a workmanlike 26-11 win over the Dolphins in Orchard Park. Buffalo's defense returned to action in fine form, holding Miami to just 262 total yards. The offense took more time but eventually found its footing: The Bills scored 23 points on their final four possessions, turning a 3-3 nail-biter into the latest comfortable win over a division rival they've owned in recent years. The schedule stays soft with a Week 9 tilt against the 1-7 Jaguars."
2021,9,5,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 2 Is Dennis Allen Tom Brady 's kryptonite? Brady has shredded just about every team in the NFC since his arrival in the conference last season, but the Saints continue to give the G.O.A.T. problems. Brady has seven interceptions in his four Bucs games against the Saints -- he's thrown 13 interceptions total in his 24 other games with Tampa Bay. The Bucs hit their bye in good shape at 6-2, but failing to close out a game in which Trevor Siemian logged significant snaps on the other side was not optimal. Said Bruce Arians: ""That was an embarrassing display of football ."""
2021,9,6,Los Angeles Rams,7-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 The Rams are all in . On Monday, the team pulled the trigger on a blockbuster trade with the Broncos that brought three-time All-Pro edge rusher Von Miller to a defense that already leads the league in sacks. Miller's play has dropped off some since his Super Bowl MVP heyday, but adding the 32-year-old to a front seven with Aaron Donald could bring out lingering greatness in Miller in the way Matthew Stafford has been revitalized on the other side of the ball. This is the type of move you see from smart teams with a sense of the moment. It's Lombardi-or-bust time in L.A."
2021,9,7,Baltimore Ravens,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 8 The Ravens hit their Week 8 bye as a quality team that has succeeded despite being ravaged by injuries. Their ability to keep their head above water goes back directly to their best and most important player. Lamar Jackson has been excellent through seven games -- you could make the case he's a better quarterback now than he was during his brilliant MVP season of 2019. Jackson has made obvious gains as a passer without losing any of the ground-game excellence that's been his trademark. The 24-year-old is currently on pace to throw for more than 4,700 yards and run for nearly 1,200. He's one of one, and the Ravens will remain in the mix as long as they can keep their QB upright."
2021,9,8,New Orleans Saints,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 You have to give it up to the Saints: On a day they lost their starting quarterback to a season-ending knee injury , they summoned everything they had left to hold off a Tom Brady -led rally and register a dramatic win over the defending champs. That right there was a gut-check W. The loss of Jameis Winston is a crushing setback for the team, of course -- Trevor Siemian is the dictionary definition of career backup , while Taysom Hill has yet to establish himself as a true QB. Still, the Saints have impact players on both sides of the ball and one of the best coaching staffs in football. They ain't dead yet."
2021,9,9,Tennessee Titans,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 10 On Sunday, the Titans grinded out an overtime win over the rival Colts that gave them total control of the AFC South. Then ... disaster struck. On Monday morning, it was reported that Derrick Henry will be sidelined 6-10 weeks after foot surgery . Henry's importance to the Titans is incalculable: Everything they do drives through the All-Pro running back, and there are sure to be questions about his extreme usage and how that might have played a role in his injury. Can the Titans still win their division without Henry? Given their cushion and the company they keep, yes. Will they remain a viable Super Bowl contender going forward? Hard to see it."
2021,9,10,Las Vegas Raiders,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Raiders should make the playoffs this year. Rich Bisacciaâs team leads the AFC West at 5-2, and weâre fresh off a 24-hour period in which the Chargers looked vulnerable in a loss to the Patriots and the Broncos traded away the heart and soul of their defense. The divisionâs other team, the Chiefs, have problems that have been exhaustively documented over the past month. Vegas comes out of the bye with a winnable game against the Giants before a trio of challenging matchups against the Chiefs , Bengals and Cowboys . These Raiders feel different than the Jon Gruden-led teams that came before them, but the true test is about to begin."
2021,9,11,Cincinnati Bengals,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals were shredded by Mike White on Sunday , an outcome that only the most emotionally broken of Cincinnati fans could have predicted. White, a backup making his first career start, became the first Jets QB to throw for 400 yards in two decades and carved up the Cincinnati defense for 32 first downs -- New York's most in a game since 1988. The Bengals' offense wasn't innocent here, either, squandering opportunities early and letting the game slip away late following a Joe Burrow interception in the fourth quarter. Cincy blew an 11-point fourth-quarter lead against a one-win team -- it's the type of loss that prompts closer examination of who these Bengals really are."
2021,9,12,Los Angeles Chargers,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 We've seen the ceiling of the Chargers' offense this season, and it's quite high. What surprises us is how low the floor is. The Bolts' attack was held in neutral for the second consecutive week on Sunday, a 27-24 loss to the Patriots that raises questions about where Los Angeles truly fits into the AFC pecking order. Justin Herbert threw for just 143 yards before a garbage-time scoring drive in the final minutes, and issues with pass protection and early-down efficiency were glaring. The Chargers' defense had its way with Patriots rookie Mac Jones and repeatedly gave the offense the opportunity to take control of the game, but Herbert and Co. couldn't do it."
2021,9,13,Kansas City Chiefs,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Chiefs found a way on Monday night , but don't mistake that for reason to think all is well in Kansas City. Andy Reid's team remains bizarrely mistake-riddled on offense, and a slew of penalties kept an inferior Giants team in the game until the end. Kansas City's big-strike attack remains absent, and struggles in the red zone can no longer be seen as an anomaly. Something just seems off with this offense, and the sight of a mortal Patrick Mahomes tentatively feeling his way through games remains a jarring viewing experience. The road ahead is brutal: Kansas City has the toughest schedule in the league the rest of the way, with a marquee matchup against Aaron Rodgers and the surging Packers up next . Buckle up."
2021,9,14,Pittsburgh Steelers,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 17 Playing without their kicker for the final two quarters in a tightly contested and physical AFC North matchup is a recipe for doom, but the Steelers still found a way by relying on some familiar elements: a suffocating defense that wouldn't let the Browns open up their attack, and a quarterback in Ben Roethlisberger who made big throws at critical junctures behind a gradually improving offensive line. Now over .500 after a grisly 1-3 start, Pittsburgh gets back-to-back favorable matchups against the Bears and Lions . Win those games, and Mike Tomlin's team could end up in first place as we approach Thanksgiving. Funny how this team always seems to find its footing."
2021,9,15,New England Patriots,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 18 On a day where Mac Jones struggled to get much going, the Patriots showed that their defense can carry them to wins against quality opponents. The 27-24 triumph over the Chargers was a textbook Classic Pats victory. Keep the game close, make an impact play, then grind out the final minutes with smart and efficient execution. The big moment was Adrian Phillips ' pick-six with 10:11 to play, but the game was won on the 14-play, 54-yard drive that chewed up nearly half the fourth quarter and produced the game-icing field goal. Said Bill Belichick: ""All in all, we made the plays that we needed to make in the fourth quarter , which is something we hadn't done as well early in the year."""
2021,9,16,Cleveland Browns,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Browns badly needed a playmaker to step up and win a huge game against the Steelers. Baker couldn't do it. Landry couldn't do it. Hooper couldn't do it. Odell ? C'mon now; we know Odell wouldn't do it. The Browns have too often looked the part of an ordinary offense this season, and they're especially vulnerable when Nick Chubb gets neutralized like he was by Pittsburgh's stout front seven on Sunday. Mayfield's left shoulder injury might be playing a role in the passing game's general ineffectiveness, but Browns fans weren't looking for excuses this year -- they were expecting their team to become a conference superpower. It hasn't happened."
2021,9,17,San Francisco 49ers,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 19 Where would the 49ers be without Deebo Samuel ? With George Kittle sidelined and Brandon Aiyuk stumbling through a sophomore slump, Samuel has been the one consistent on an otherwise inconsistent offense in San Francisco. Frankly, Samuel's greatness feels overlooked when we talk about the best wide receivers in football. Chew on this: Samuel is the only wideout with three 150-yard receiving games this season, and he just passed Jerry Rice to set a franchise record for the most receiving yards (819) in the first seven games of a season. The Niners scored on their final seven possessions on Sunday against the Bears , and Samuel was at the center of everything."
2021,9,18,Seattle Seahawks,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 22 Geno Smith began his Sunday with 14 straight completions and two touchdown passes in an eventual blowout of the lowly Jaguars, but let's not get it twisted. The Seahawks desperately need Russell Wilson back on the field if they want to re-enter the NFC playoff picture in a legitimate manner. Monday brought progress on that front: Wilson revealed via social media that the pin used to stabilize his fractured middle finger has been removed. It's a sign Wilson's recovery is on schedule, and the hope is that the franchise star is back in action when the Seahawks return from their bye in Week 10."
2021,9,19,Minnesota Vikings,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 The prime-time stage was set up for the Vikings on Sunday night. Dak Prescott was inactive, and when Kirk Cousins led Minnesota on an immediate touchdown drive, it looked like the start of a four-hour Halloween party at U.S. Bank Stadium. But the Dallas defense took control after that, and the Vikings' defense wilted against Cooper Rush in the final minutes. I'll repeat: The Vikings' defense wilted against Cooper Rush in the final minutes. Mike Zimmer's team had a chance to make a statement and instead came off as an also-ran exposed."
2021,9,20,Indianapolis Colts,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ With their chances to win a division seemingly hanging in the balance, Carson Wentz blinked. The Colts quarterback threw a pair of brutal interceptions in the final 7:30 of play in Sunday's overtime loss to the Titans, including a pick-six that will live in infamy . Wentz had thrown just one interception entering Week 8, but his meltdown at an inflection point in the season has to be troubling for Frank Reich and the Indy braintrust. The news of Derrick Henry 's foot injury keeps the door slightly ajar in the AFC South, but the Colts have put themselves in a deep hole."
2021,9,21,Carolina Panthers,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 25 The status of Christian McCaffrey is cloudy and perplexing, even if you're not a CMC fantasy owner. Matt Rhule told reporters on Monday that the star running back -- sidelined since September with a hamstring injury -- is scheduled to return to practice this week with the hope that he can play in Week 9 or 10. This is the same hamstring injury that didn't even warrant an immediate trip to injured reserve when McCaffrey was initially hurt back in Week 3, so doubts about the team's ability to properly monitor the situation are fair. The Panthers need McCaffrey to make a playoff run, but they also know one more setback could wipe out a second straight year of the 25-year-old's prime. You can feel the tension of the situation from outer space."
2021,9,22,Atlanta Falcons,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 20 So much for the theory that the Falcons were building momentum on offense. The Arthur Smith-led attack cratered on Sunday against the Panthers, managing just 213 total yards in a 19-13 loss . Playing without top wideout Calvin Ridley -- out of action for the second time in three games as he addresses mental health issues -- Matt Ryan suffered one of his worst games as a pro. The veteran passed for just 146 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions and suffered a gash to his left hand when he was accidentally stepped on in the second quarter. With Ridley's timetable unclear, Atlanta needs to find some contributors on offense beyond Kyle Pitts and Cordarrelle Patterson ."
2021,9,23,Denver Broncos,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 21 An unsightly 17-10 win over the Washington Football Team obviously wasn't enough to convince the Broncos braintrust it had built a contender. Denver traded the longtime face of its defense on Monday, sending Von Miller to the Rams for second- and third-round picks in 2022. It's a fairly modest return for a franchise great, but you understand the decision. Denver is a middling team, and Miller is a 32-year-old outside linebacker making a ton of money. His age means he's unlikely to be part of the next contending Broncos team, but it's still sad to see his often-brilliant tenure with the franchise end with a trade-deadline transaction involving mid-round picks. The Broncos feel adrift."
2021,9,24,Chicago Bears,3-5,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 23 Justin Fields couldn't get the Bears a win on Sunday, but the rookie made significant gains in a 33-22 loss to the 49ers. The first-round pick threw a touchdown pass and went over 100 yards rushing for the first time as a pro, the highlight being an incredible 22-yard scoring run on a play that would have left most QBs in a heap 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. The defense left much more to be desired. Playing without Khalil Mack , Chicago surrendered seven straight scoring drives to the Niners, including three touchdowns in the second half. Matt Nagy -- who missed Sunday's game due to a COVID-19 designation -- won't make it to January with too many more efforts like that."
2021,9,25,New York Giants,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Giants are so injury plagued that you start to wonder if Joe Judge broke a mirror while walking under a ladder with a black cat this summer. Big Blue entered a prime-time matchup versus the Chiefs missing Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Kenny Golladay (hip). By the fourth quarter, they were without Sterling Shepard (quad) and Dante Pettis (shoulder). Patrick Grahamâs defense kept New York in the game, but youâre not going to beat the Chiefs at Arrowhead -- even this slumping, troubled version of the defending AFC champs -- if you score just 17 points. The Giants will eventually get many of their key players back on the field, but theyâve dug a hole that will be difficult to escape."
2021,9,26,Philadelphia Eagles,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Finding ways to take pressure off Jalen Hurts should be an every-week goal for the Eagles. Perhaps it already was, but they actually found solutions through the running game in a 44-6 win over the Lions. Eagles running backs rushed 39 times for 165 yards, with Jordan Howard and Boston Scott each scoring twice. The blowout victory was especially important for rookie head coach Nick Sirianni, who would have found himself under extreme scrutiny had Philadelphia faltered against the winless Lions. The Cowboys are running away with the NFC East, but the Eagles can keep themselves in the postseason picture with a win over the slumping Chargers on Sunday ."
2021,9,27,New York Jets,2-5,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 31 You have to go back years to find the last truly feel-good Jets win. There were a few during the Fitzmagic season of 2015, and itâs been six years of almost relentless darkness since. Which is what made Sundayâs performance by Mike White all the more sweet for beleaguered Gang Green supporters. White carved up the Bengals in a dramatic 34-31 win at MetLife Stadium, throwing for three TDs and becoming the first Jets quarterback in more than 20 years to pass for 400 yards in a game. After the win, Robert Saleh kept the door open for White to continue as starter even after Zach Wilson recovers from a knee injury. Said the coach: ""We'll go day-to-day, but anything is possible, right? Anything is possible.â"
2021,9,28,Washington Football Team,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 27 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Washington is having a bad season -- and itâs unlikely to get much better. Sunday brought another uninspired effort in a 17-10 setback to the Broncos , the fourth straight loss for Ron Riveraâs team. The defense has been a huge disappointment in Washington, but the struggles of the offense canât be overlooked. This is especially so in scoring position: Washington has come away with zero points on 10 of its last 13 trips inside the opponentsâ 30-yard line. That includes two interceptions, three blocked field goals and five turnovers on downs. Itâs near-impossible inefficiency for a team that was expected to contend for the NFC East title."
2021,9,29,Miami Dolphins,1-7,"Previous rank: No. 29 Seven is an unlucky number for the Dolphins. They're up to seven consecutive losses to the Bills (outscored 258-123 in those games) and seven consecutive losses on the year after a season-opening win in Foxborough that feels like it happened in another dimension. After the latest setback -- which featured a confused, listless performance from the offense -- Brian Flores waited longer than usual before addressing reporters and then acknowledged he had taken extra time to ruminate on a season that has gone horribly awry. ""Today, I really just kind of sat there,"" he said. ""It's a tough loss, it's a number of losses in a row, so I just figured we'll let the players go."" It's taking a toll."
2021,9,30,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-6,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Jaguars returned from their bye with a blowout loss to the Seahawks in which they made Geno Smith look like Joe Montana. Trevor Lawrence struggled through perhaps his worst game as a pro, but itâs hard to imagine many quarterbacks finding success with the supporting cast that currently surrounds the No. 1 overall pick. Importing some playmakers to help Lawrence has to be a top priority for the Jaguars when they assess the next step for the organization. Is it fair to wonder if Urban Meyer will be around when those decisions get made?"
2021,9,31,Detroit Lions,0-8,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Lions are 0-8 for the first time since their infamous winless season of 2008, and their performance in Sundayâs 44-6 loss to the Eagles makes you concerned for all parties involved in Detroit. Dan Campbellâs team failed in all phases against Philadelphia, but pass protection has reached a crisis point with offensive tackle Taylor Decker and center Frank Ragnow sidelined with injuries. Jared Goff was sacked five times in the loss, including four sacks in the first half alone. Goff is not a nimble man in the pocket, but he has no chance when the Lions are getting worked up front like they were on Sunday."
2021,9,32,Houston Texans,1-7,"Previous rank: No. 32 Another week, another punishing loss for the worst team in football. The biggest story around the Texans remains Deshaun Watson , who, if recent reports are correct , will not be moved ahead of Tuesdayâs trade deadline . Being rid of Watson and all that comes with him would have been a positive development for the Texans, but there will be more time to address the situation again in the months ahead. As for the actual on-field product, Houston is talent poor and outclassed every time it steps on the field. Years of poor draft-capital management and questionable roster moves have left the franchise barren. The upcoming offseason will be the most critical in the organizationâs history."
2021,10,1,Arizona Cardinals,8-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 No Kyler Murray . No Nuk Hopkins . No problem for the Cardinals, who received robust contributions from Colt McCoy and Christian Kirk and a monster performance from James Conner in a 31-17 win over the 49ers at Levi's Stadium. It was pretty much close to a perfect afternoon for Kliff Kingsbury. The coach picked up a division win that further buried a rival, while his two most important players rested injuries that could be season-wreckers if not treated with the necessary caution. Back to Conner: The first-year Cardinal had three scores on Sunday and now leads the league with 11 touchdowns. After some dicey times in the desert, general manager Steve Keim is on a heater."
2021,10,2,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 5 It's time to ask questions about Rob Gronkowski and the long-term impact he can make with the Bucs for the balance of 2021. Following a sizzling start to the season, Gronk missed four games with rib and lung injuries, then exited the Week 8 loss to the Saints after just six snaps with back spasms. It's the same back that required three separate surgeries from 2009 to 2016. The Bucs have the luxury of former first-round pick O.J. Howard 's presence to absorb Gronkowski's snaps, but we saw how unstoppable this offense was when Gronk was healthy in September. It's fair to wonder if we'll see that guy again."
2021,10,3,Tennessee Titans,7-2,"Previous rank: No. 9 Derrick Henry might be the most talented player on the Titans, but dismissing this resilient and battle-tested team is always a mistake. Case in point: Tennessee's 28-16 dismantling of the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday Night Football . Playing against an NFC powerhouse, the Titans looked like the more prepared, better disciplined team. Tennessee's defense has been a revelation during a brilliant four-game winning streak that has included conquests over the Bills , Chiefs , Colts and Rams. The star in L.A. was Jeffery Simmons , who had three of the Titans' five sacks of Matthew Stafford . That's more sacks than any member of the franchise has recorded in a single game in 13 years."
2021,10,4,Green Bay Packers,7-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 You can pile on Jordan Love for an underwhelming first start as a pro, but make no mistake: The Packers don't lose on Sunday if Aaron Rodgers had made the decisions that could have kept him in the starting lineup. The Chiefs and their deeply dysfunctional offense were dying to hand Sunday's game to Green Bay, but a late touchdown to Allen Lazard is all the Love-led offense could muster in a frustrating 13-7 loss . The offense was bad, but the Packers were an outright mess on special teams: Green Bay failed to convert two field-goal attempts and muffed a punt that led to a Chiefs field goal. Add it up, and the math ain't pretty."
2021,10,5,Dallas Cowboys,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 2 This game will humble you. The Cowboys entered Sunday as a universally recognized superpower in the NFC. Then the day brought a blowout loss that was far worse than the 30-16 final score indicated. This was a defeat that summoned bad memories of 2020: The Broncos rushed for 190 yards against a disinterested-looking Dallas defense, while Dak Prescott wasn't able to eclipse 100 yards passing until there were only 10 minutes remaining on the game clock. The thousands of Broncos fans who invaded AT&T Stadium got their money's worth: This was a three-hour party at Dallas' expense. Mike McCarthy's staff has a clear directive: Study the tape ... then burn it. ""Definitely shocked,"" Prescott said. ""They whooped us in every aspect."""
2021,10,6,Baltimore Ravens,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Ravens won on Sunday with a relentless offense that wouldn't let up. Lamar Jackson threw for 266 yards and ran for 120 more, Devonta Freeman looked rejuvenated in a supporting role and Justin Tucker delivered the overtime field goal that clinched a 34-31 win over the Vikings. The Ravens remain an imperfect operation -- the defense was pushed around early and late, and the special teams gave up a 98-yard kickoff return for touchdown on the first play of the second half that would have broken a weaker team. That's not Baltimore, a tough and resilient squad that enters the season's midpoint atop the AFC North."
2021,10,7,Los Angeles Rams,7-2,"Previous rank: No. 6 Sometimes you just don't have it. Better in November than January, right? The Rams were an undisciplined mess on Sunday Night Football , committing a season-high 12 penalties for 115 yards in a 28-16 loss to the surging Titans at Hollywood Park. An extremely suspect roughing-the-passer call on Aaron Donald was the nail in the coffin for L.A., but Sean McVay's team never seriously threatened once the Titans reeled off 21 points in the second quarter -- 14 of them coming off Matthew Stafford interceptions, including a killer pick-six by Kevin Byard . An ugly performance, no doubt, but even great teams can deliver a dud during a long season. The Rams hope this was it."
2021,10,8,Buffalo Bills,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 Josh Allen didn't sugarcoat his evaluation of the Bills after a stunning 9-6 loss to the Jaguars. "" Played like s--- ,"" Allen said after the game. ""Excuse my language, but that starts with me. So I've got to be better for this team."" Allen turned the ball over three times on Sunday, but it wasn't his struggle alone: The offensive line continually failed its star QB, while play-caller Brian Daboll was unable to cook up an in-game adjustment to counter Jacksonville's two-high safety scheme that took away Buffalo's beloved big-play strikes. Is the book out on Daboll's offense in the same way we've seen Andy Reid's formerly unstoppable attack sputter out in Kansas City? The coming weeks will tell us a lot about this team and its Super Bowl hopes."
2021,10,9,Los Angeles Chargers,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Chargers got the Justin Herbert performance they needed and returned to the win column as a result. The talented second-year passer was back to his gunslinger ways in a hard-fought 27-24 road win over the Eagles that -- combined with a Raiders loss -- moved the Chargers into a first-place tie in the AFC West at the season's virtual midpoint. Herbert completed 32 of 38 passes for 356 yards and accounted for three touchdowns, rebounding from back-to-back subpar performances in losses to the Patriots and Ravens . ""We have an elite quarterback that can really throw it anywhere on the field,"" coach Brandon Staley said after the game. Herbert next gets a Vikings defense that just surrendered 500 yards in an overtime loss to Baltimore ."
2021,10,10,Cleveland Browns,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Browns will not miss Odell Beckham Jr. . Cleveland's offense looked just fine without its No. 1 wide receiver who was never a No. 1 receiver at all -- scoring early and often in a 41-16 win over the Bengals. Nick Chubb 's 70-yard TD rumble in the third quarter served as the knockout blow, but the win also featured a strong performance from Baker Mayfield , a solid starter who was unfairly maligned during Beckham's apparent smear campaign-by-proxy on the way out the door . It's been an up-and-down season for the Browns, but this remains a talented, well-coached team capable of ripping off a big run."
2021,10,11,New England Patriots,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 If Bill Belichick could face off against Sam Darnold every week, the Patriots would never lose a game. The coach continued his mastery over the former first-round pick, who threw three interceptions without a touchdown drive in New England's 24-6 win over the Panthers in Charlotte. It's the third straight win for the Pats, who are within a half-game of the Bills in a suddenly tight AFC East race. Mac Jones was better than he was Week 8 in Los Angeles , but the Pats won because of their opportunistic defense -- J.C. Jackson had two INTs, including the game-icing pick-six -- and a run game that rolled up 151 yards and a touchdown. A Week 10 showdown with the Browns could have huge playoff ramifications."
2021,10,12,Kansas City Chiefs,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 13 The good news is obvious: Even without style points, the Chiefs won consecutive nail-biters over a seven-day period and enter the back half of their schedule just a game out in the loss column in the AFC West. The bad news is equally obvious: The offense is still puzzlingly, profoundly broken. Fixing it will be a titanic in-season challenge for Andy Reid and his staff, but let's give credit to a Kansas City defense that has kept the reigning conference champs afloat in tense times. Steve Spagnuolo's D dialed up the pressure on Jordan Love (seven hits) and took a shutout deep into the fourth quarter. The Chiefs exist in a strange upside-down world where the defense is being asked to carry the offense. None of this feels sustainable."
2021,10,13,New Orleans Saints,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 The Saints deserve credit for staging a dramatic comeback against the Falcons at a delirious Superdome on Sunday, but the disappointment of the game went beyond the late Cordarrelle Patterson catch-and-run and Younghoe Koo kick that sealed their fate. Trevor Siemian stepped in for Jameis Winston and got very little help from his pass catchers, who had five drops before the game reached halftime. Neither Siemian nor Taysom Hill would be classified as electric throwers of the football, so New Orleans can't afford to kick away opportunities to make chunk plays like they did repeatedly against Atlanta. Michael Thomas is not walking through that door -- leaving the Saints with a problem they may not be able to address until the spring."
2021,10,14,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 14 Ray-Ray McCloud's fumble let the Bears back in the game, and the defense faltered with a chance to close out a win, but Ben Roethlisberger still had enough juice to save the day. Big Ben led Pittsburgh on the 50th game-winning drive of his Hall of Fame career, a possession that culminated with a Chris Boswell field goal that secured a 29-27 victory . The Steelers have won 19 straight home games on Monday Night Football . It doesn't get any easier from here: Pittsburgh's remaining opponents have a .553 winning percentage. You get the feeling that every week is going to feel like a street fight with this team."
2021,10,15,Las Vegas Raiders,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Raiders capped a tragic and tumultuous week with a painful loss to the Giants at the Meadowlands. Derek Carr threw a third-quarter pick-six and lost a fumble with the Raiders just 13 yards from the potential game-tying score in the final minute. Vegas had hoped for a positive result on the field five days after the deadly DUI crash that prompted multiple felony charges against Henry Ruggs III , who was released by the team after the accident. On Monday, the same day Vegas signed veteran DeSean Jackson to replace Ruggs, the team cut ties with troubled cornerback Damon Arnette, another 2020 first-round pick. Shutting out outside issues has become a weekly challenge for this group."
2021,10,16,Cincinnati Bengals,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals were blown out at home by the Browns on Sunday and have been outscored 55-16 in their last four-and-a-half quarters of play, dating back to Week 8's collapse against the Jets. Denzel Ward's 99-yard pick-six set the tone for a frustrating afternoon for the Bengals, who turned the ball over three times and surrendered big-play scores through the air and on the ground to a Cleveland team that beat them in all phases. Turbulence has arrived, and this will be an important test for Zac Taylor in his quest to instill a new culture in Cincinnati. Will Cincy adjust and move forward ... or crumble and fall apart, like so many past Bengals teams?"
2021,10,17,Denver Broncos,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 23 In their first game without Von Miller , the Broncos were the best version of themselves in a stunning upset of the Cowboys. The running game -- led by Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon -- operated as a runaway train, while Teddy Bridgewater outplayed Dak Prescott with an efficient performance that saw big contributions from Jerry Jeudy and Tim Patrick . Then there was the defense, which shut out the No. 1 offense in football until garbage time and made you think Denver might still have greatness on that side of the ball -- even with a franchise legend like Miller cashing his checks elsewhere. This was the type of performance that changes the way you look at a team."
2021,10,18,Indianapolis Colts,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 20 The Colts were an absolute freight train against the Jets. Frank Reich's squad was dominant from the jump on Thursday Night Football , scoring touchdowns on six of its first seven possessions en route to a 45-30 win at Lucas Oil Stadium. Jonathan Taylor 's 78-yard touchdown run in the third quarter was the exclamation point on an outrageous performance by the Colts' ground game, which rolled up an NFL season-best 260 rushing yards at 8.7 yards per carry by the waning minutes of the third quarter. Not all opponents will be as terribly unprepared as the Jets were in prime time, but the Colts sent another signal that they are a resilient team that appears unwilling to concede the AFC South."
2021,10,19,Seattle Seahawks,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 18 Geno Smith lit up the Jaguars in Week 8 , giving the Seahawks some necessary positive vibes as they went into their Week 9 bye. Now the hope is that Russell Wilson will return to action and put together a win streak that gets Seattle back into the postseason picture. As expected, the Seahawks mostly struggled during the time their franchise star was on the mend from finger surgery, dropping three of four games in which Wilson missed some or all of the action. Smith did a great job powering the offense through DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett in the blowout win over Jacksonville, and it's a game plan that should continue going forward. If the Seahawks don't Let Russ Cook now, they'll be preparing their own meals from home when the playoffs arrive."
2021,10,20,Atlanta Falcons,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Falcons deserve a trophy for figuring out how to unlock Cordarrelle Patterson . The veteran is one of the greatest special teams players in history, but it's taken until his ninth season for a coach -- hello, Arthur Smith -- to transform him into a consistent offensive weapon. Patterson was at it again in a dramatic win over the Saints, piling up 136 scrimmage yards, including the dramatic 64-yard catch-and-run that set up Younghoe Koo's 29-yard field goal as time expired. Patterson played the role of savior after a hideous fourth-quarter collapse summoned ghosts of 28-3. Said Patterson after the win: ""We just like to give our fans a heart attack, just to keep them on their toes, make sure they are paying attention."" We're watching."
2021,10,21,Minnesota Vikings,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Vikings are a formidable team with a fatal flaw: They have no idea how to close out games. It happened again on Sunday in Baltimore, where Minnesota kicked away a 14-point third-quarter lead in a crushing 34-31 overtime loss to the Ravens. The Kirk Cousins -led offense remains maddeningly hot and cold, with too many quickly extinguished possessions that put the defense in a bad spot. The Ravens ran 89 plays compared to 52 for the Vikings -- and when Anthony Barr came up with an acrobatic interception in overtime, Minnesota's offense responded with a three-and-out that doomed the team. This has been a season of immense frustration; it's fair to wonder if the Vikings are close to a breaking point."
2021,10,22,New York Giants,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 25 The arrival has come later than expected, but the defense is here now. The Giants harassed the Raiders into three turnovers on Sunday, including a pick-six and the Derek Carr strip-sack in the final minute en route to a 23-16 win at MetLife Stadium. These have been gutty recent performances by New York, which played once again without star running back Saquon Barkley or top receiver Sterling Shepard . Daniel Jones has steadied the ship on offense, but it's Patrick Graham's defense that's making New York relevant again: Big Blue has allowed just 13 points per game over the past three games after giving up 29.5 points on average in their first six contests. That'll play."
2021,10,23,Chicago Bears,3-6,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 24 The outcome was disappointing, but there were still plenty of positives to take out of Monday's 29-27 loss to the Steelers. Matt Nagy's team kept its composure in a raucous road environment and continued to battle on a night when it felt like every call from officials went against them. Then there was the late go-ahead drive engineered by Justin Fields : A seven-play, 75-yard march that featured a 39-yard completion to Allen Robinson and a gorgeous touchdown pass to Darnell Mooney . Sean Desai's defense was a discombobulated mess in the final Steelers drive that cost Chicago the game, but Fields' heady performance was another indication the Bears finally have a young quarterback they can build around."
2021,10,24,San Francisco 49ers,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 17 It's time to ask some hard questions. The Niners laid yet another egg at home on Sunday, a 31-17 setback to the Cardinals -- the team's 11th loss in 12 games at Levi's Stadium. A dreary defense had no answers for an Arizona team playing without Kyler Murray , DeAndre Hopkins or Chase Edmonds , who was lost on the Cardinals' first offensive snap of the game. Things were only marginally better on the other side of the ball, where the return of George Kittle failed to revive an offense that continues to fade further away from the glories of 2019. The 49ers lack so much this season -- on Sunday, it was effort and urgency against a compromised rival."
2021,10,25,Carolina Panthers,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Sam Darnold era in Carolina reached its nadir on Sunday against the Patriots . The struggling quarterback appeared skittish and tentative in Joe Brady's offense, throwing three interceptions -- including a crushing pick-six -- in Darnold's latest nightmare performance against Bill Belichick. Matt Rhule elected to keep Darnold behind center for the entire game, despite his struggles, but Rhule could lose his team if he doesn't give backup P.J. Walker a chance to fix a broken offense. Carolina's decision to trade for Darnold and pick up his fifth-year option is beginning to look like a huge error in judgment by the organization."
2021,10,26,Philadelphia Eagles,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 26 Nick Sirianni cannot buy a win at home. The rookie head coach fell to 0-4 at Lincoln Financial Field -- and received an unwelcome bouquet of flowers for his team's efforts -- following a 27-24 loss to the Chargers. Philadelphia showed progress on offense. The running game thrived, while Jalen Hurts and rookie wideout DeVonta Smith showed some welcome chemistry in the second half, but the defense continued to struggle, especially against the pass. Chargers star Justin Herbert became the fifth opposing quarterback to complete at least 80 percent of his pass attempts in a game against the Eagles this season. It's a brutal trend, tying an NFL record held by the 2015 Bucs. Lots of season left."
2021,10,27,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 30 Josh Allen was the dominant force in the Bills game on Sunday. Just not the Josh Allen we all expected. Linebacker Josh Allen -- the Jaguars' Josh Allen -- was a stud in an upset win over Buffalo, piling up a game-high eight tackles to go with a sack, interception and fumble recovery in the 9-6 stunner . Allen and the rest of the Jags' front seven were relentless in pursuit of the Bills' Josh Allen , who was routinely chased from the pocket and forced to check down to receivers against a defense that refused to let Buffalo beat it with downfield strikes. After a tumultuous -- and, frankly, disastrous -- start to his tenure in Jacksonville, Urban Meyer has a signature victory to build off."
2021,10,28,Washington Football Team,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 28 Much was made of Washington's fearsome front seven entering the season. Anchored by a pair of rising stars in Chase Young and Montez Sweat , the belief was that Young & Sweaty (my nickname, not theirs) would disrupt game plans on a weekly basis and put Washington in position to successfully defend its NFC East title. It hasn't worked out that way. Young, last year's No. 2 overall pick, has disappointed with just 1.5 sacks, and Sweat is now on the shelf for up to a month after sustaining a broken jaw in Week 8's loss to the Broncos. Ron Rivera's defense was built to win up front -- it's just one of many things that haven't come together as planned for the Football Team."
2021,10,29,Miami Dolphins,2-7,"Previous rank: No. 29 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Dolphins committed five turnovers on Sunday, a guaranteed way to ensure a loss in the NFL -- unless you're playing the Houston Texans. A win is a win , but questions continue to swirl around the quarterback position after a broken finger forced Tua Tagovailoa out of action due to injury for the fifth time this season. Tua has been unable to stay healthy at the college or pro levels, a reality that doesn't build the case that he's the long-term answer for the Dolphins. This all still feels like it's headed in a certain -- morally dubious -- direction in Miami. A bad look for everyone involved."
2021,10,30,New York Jets,2-6,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 27 Why is Jets Sadness so predictable? Mike White set records and galvanized the fanbase in a Week 8 win over Cincinnati at the Meadowlands. Four days later, an injured White watched from the sideline as the Jets authored one of the worst defensive performances in franchise history. The Colts' offense did whatever it wanted on Thursday night, scoring touchdowns on six of its first seven possessions en route to a gnarly 45-23 blowout at Lucas Oil Stadium. How bad was it for the Jets? The Colts needed less than three full quarters to amass the most rushing yards by any team in a game this season. Itâs all a terrible look for first-year head coach Robert Saleh, whose defense has been arguably footballâs worst for a month. Four days of happiness for Jets fans. That's it."
2021,10,31,Detroit Lions,0-8,"Previous rank: No. 31 The second half of the season could go one of two ways for Dan Campbell: The Lions could continue to fight and hang tough in games and eventually pull out a win or three; or, the losses create a snowball effect, hopelessness sets in and, eventually, Detroit reaches an unsavory final record that nobody wants connected to their rÃ©sumÃ©. The bye arrived at a helpful time for a team trying to escape an avalanche. â This season is not over ,â Tight end T.J. Hockenson said after the team's Week 8 loss to the Eagles . âAnd weâre able to write the story with what guys want to do, what we want to do as a team and where we want to go with this organization and with this city.â"
2021,10,32,Houston Texans,1-8,"Previous rank: No. 32 Tyrod Taylor was supposed to bring veteran stability to the Texans in his return to the lineup after missing six games with a hamstring injury. That didnât happen. Taylor threw three interceptions and was sacked five times in a grisly 17-9 loss to the Dolphins that made Houston the 12th team in NFL history to follow a season-opening win with eight consecutive defeats. Sundayâs results aside, Taylor probably gives Houston the best chance to win on a weekly basis, but it might make more sense to continue an evaluation on rookie passer Davis Mills . Week 18 canât arrive soon enough for this franchise."
2021,11,1,Green Bay Packers,8-2,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The defense is on a heater and it's made Green Bay the most balanced team in football. The Packers registered an impressive shutout of the Seahawks at chilly Lambeau Field and have now held Kyler Murray , Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson to 34 combined points across the past three games. Aaron Rodgers returned from his one-game COVID-19 misadventure and showed some rust, guiding the Pack to just three points in the first three quarters before putting the game away with a pair of late touchdown drives. Green Bay dodged disaster when it learned Aaron Jones is unlikely to miss more than two games with a knee injury sustained in the second half. The schedule stays tough with a rugged divisional matchup this week in Minnesota ."
2021,11,2,Tennessee Titans,8-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Titans are the hottest team in football -- and they've made history in their surge to the top of the AFC standings. Mike Vrabel's team held off the Saints, 23-21 , and became the second NFL team ever to win five consecutive games against opponents that qualified for the playoffs the season before. The offense still feels limited with Derrick Henry on the shelf, but the Titans know how to grind out victories with a defense that is vastly improved. Jeffery Simmons collected two more sacks -- giving him five in the past two weeks -- and Tennessee made the key stop on New Orleans' two-point conversion attempt in the final minute. An overdue layup against the Texans awaits."
2021,11,3,Dallas Cowboys,7-2,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ You don't want to play an angry Cowboys team. A week after getting blown out by the Broncos in one of the most surprising outcomes of the season, Dallas returned the favor against a Falcons team that was in the wrong place at the wrong time. After the 43-3 demolition -- a game in which Dallas took a 36-3 lead into halftime -- Jerry Jones said he couldn't remember a more dominant performance in his 30-plus years as owner. The win -- paired with a Cardinals loss to the Panthers -- moves the Cowboys one game out of the top spot in the NFC as they hit a critical juncture in their schedule with matchups against the Chiefs , Raiders and Saints over a 12-day span. Buckle up."
2021,11,4,Arizona Cardinals,8-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Cardinals are doing the right thing. It might be painful in the short term, but it's the prudent move to keep Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins out of game action, even if it means ugly results like Sunday's 34-10 loss to the Panthers. Murray attempted to play through a lingering shoulder injury last December and Arizona's playoff hopes imploded. Giving Murray's ankle and Hopkins' hamstring the necessary time to heal will help the Cardinals in the long run as they attempt to make a deep playoff run. The team's 7-0 start to the season provided Kliff Kingsbury's team with some cushion. He's smart to use it now."
2021,11,5,Buffalo Bills,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ The Jets were just what the doctor ordered for the Bills' slumping offense. Josh Allen picked apart New York's weak defense, throwing for 366 yards with two scores in a 45-17 win at the Meadowlands. Allen's offensive line provided him ample time to work from the pocket, and he re-established his connection with star receiver Stefon Diggs , who enjoyed just his second 100-yard day of the season. The Jets were a nice confidence booster, but we'll need to see more evidence before declaring that Brian Daboll and Co. have successfully counteracted the game plans that stifled the attack before Sunday."
2021,11,6,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Tom Brady had no interest in speaking with the media after Sunday's upset 29-19 loss to the Washington Football Team, and you didn't need a degree in psychology to know why. Brady never found a groove against Washington's revitalized defense and was trapped on the sidelines as Tampa Bay's D surrendered a marathon 19-play, 80-yard drive that chewed up most of the fourth quarter and ended with a touchdown that put the game out of reach. One can imagine Brady became further peeved when he heard Bruce Arians' blunt assessment of the QB's struggles in his own press conference. An ugly afternoon for the defending champs."
2021,11,7,Kansas City Chiefs,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Patrick Mahomes back? Patrick Mahomes back! There was reason for extreme optimism around Chiefs Kingdom after Mahomes looked unstoppable in a 41-17 beatdown of the Raiders in Vegas. This was the vintage Kansas City offense that had been missing for most of the season, and it all centered around the former MVP behind center: Mahomes finished with 35 completions on 50 passing attempts for 406 yards, five touchdowns and zero turnovers. His relentless play-making ability wore down the Raiders in the second half and served as a reminder that Mahomes in full flight is one of the best to ever play. ""That guy is great,"" Tyreek Hill said of his QB. ""He's unbelievable. I can't ask to be in a better position with a better quarterback."""
2021,11,8,New England Patriots,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ It almost feels like the good times never left Gillette Stadium -- they just took a one-year sabbatical in 2020 like the rest of us. On Sunday, the Pats rolled over the Browns for their fourth consecutive victory in a 3.5-hour party at Foxborough. Two days earlier, Bill Belichick gushed about Josh McDaniels , telling reporters he didn't believe the offensive coordinator ""has any weaknesses as a coach."" Then McDaniels dialed up a game plan against Cleveland that produced six touchdowns in eight possessions when starter Mac Jones was on the field. Jones was back in a groove in what has been the most impressive season of any rookie QB by a wide margin. If he continues to mature, there's no limit how far the Pats can go in a wide-open AFC."
2021,11,9,Los Angeles Rams,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Rams certainly won the publicity game with their splashy moves to acquire Von Miller and Odell Beckham , but their slump on the field has now stretched across consecutive ugly prime-time performances. Monday nightâs 31-10 loss to the 49ers was another feather in the cap of Kyle Shanahan, who has made it a habit to outshine fellow wunderkind Sean McVay in head-to-head matchups between NFC West rivals. Matthew Stafford was let down by multiple dropped passes from his receivers in L.A.'s first game without Robert Woods , who tore his ACL during Friday's practice. Both Miller and Beckham were quiet in their first game action -- that will have to change if the all-in Rams are to get where they want to be."
2021,11,10,Baltimore Ravens,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Lamar Jackson has mixed in some lows with the highs during the brilliant start to his pro career, but it's hard to remember Jackson looking as demonstrably frustrated as he was on Thursday night in Miami . Jackson and the Ravens' offense were a mess in what was supposed to be a homecoming party for the quarterback against the NFL's 30th-ranked defense. Brian Flores sent waves of blitzes at Jackson, overwhelming the pass protection and repeatedly putting the fourth-year pro in impossible situations. Much will be made about the Dolphins creating a playbook for how to attack Baltimore -- it's on John Harbaugh and Co. to counterpunch after a humbling loss . ""We just weren't ready,"" Harbaugh said , ""and that's on me."""
2021,11,11,Los Angeles Chargers,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ The Chargers remain a frustratingly inconsistent operation, particularly on offense. A week after Justin Herbert and Co. appeared to shake their slump in a win over the Eagles, the L.A. attack was again out of sync in a 27-20 loss to the Vikings, the Bolts' third loss in five games at SoFi Stadium this season. The hit-or-miss nature of the offense is putting the other side of the ball in a vulnerable position, as Los Angeles continues to lose the time of possession battle on a weekly basis. A tired Chargers defense had the Vikings at second-and-17 and third-and-20 on the final possession of the game and surrendered first downs in each instance as Minnesota successfully ran out the clock for the win."
2021,11,12,Cleveland Browns,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ At some point, we might have to believe what the Browns are telling us: This is an inconsistent team incapable of putting together a sustained stretch of good play. Sunday's 45-7 loss to the Patriots served as an indictment on both sides of the ball and left players openly questioning the coaching staff's ability to make adjustments after it was over. The Browns put up a touchdown on their first drive and never scored again. The defense surrendered scoring drives covering 99, 95, 92 and 83 yards. Last place in the tightly packed AFC North is not where Cleveland thought it would be with seven games to go. The disappointment is real."
2021,11,13,New Orleans Saints,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 13 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Sean Payton was not a happy man after Sunday's 23-21 loss to the Titans ... and we get it. His kicker missed two extra points, a potential game-tying two-point conversion was foiled in the final minute, and officials cost New Orleans seven points with a highly questionable roughing the passer penalty. Credit the Saints for hanging tough against a red-hot opponent, on the road, with four key offensive starters sidelined by injuries. But it's the result that matters most, and New Orleans missed out on a golden opportunity to move into a first-place tie with the Bucs atop the NFC South."
2021,11,14,Minnesota Vikings,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Vikings' offense needed to start taking chances again. The attack had become increasingly conservative in recent weeks, with Kirk Cousins repeatedly throwing short of the sticks. That changed in Sunday's win over the Chargers, a critical victory in which Justin Jefferson re-established himself as the most explosive playmaker on the team. Jefferson was uncoverable at times, finishing with nine catches for 143 yards, including the crucial 27-yard catch late in the fourth quarter that helped Minnesota run out the clock to seal the win. Per Next Gen Stats, Cousins was 5-for-6 for 114 yards when targeting Jefferson more than 10 yards downfield. It's a trend that must continue with a critical showdown against the Packers on tap."
2021,11,15,Indianapolis Colts,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 18 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Colts came out of the creampuff portion of their schedule with wins over the Jets and Jaguars , but Sunday's victory over a feisty Jacksonville team left more questions than answers. The offense struggled to get anything going after a fast start, and Carson Wentz was back to making the kind of ill-advised throws that got Indy beat by the Titans in Week 8. A bad team like Jacksonville won't always make you pay, but Wentz won't be nearly as fortunate with matchups against the Bills and Buccaneers on tap. The Colts have yet to win a game against a team with a winning record this season -- if they don't come out the next two weeks with at least a split, they'll confirm their also-ran status."
2021,11,16,Cincinnati Bengals,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The bye came at an ideal time for defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo. Statistically speaking, the Bengals were one of the best defenses in football over the first seven weeks of the season -- but things fell apart in back-to-back losses to the Jets and Browns . Cincinnati surrendered 75 points in the two losses, struggling to stop both the run and the pass. Now in his third season on the job, Anarumo's future in Cincy might hinge on what happens the rest of the way. Said Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard: ""We gotta look at ourselves and see what team we're really made of these last weeks."""
2021,11,17,San Francisco 49ers,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 24 With his team in virtual must-win territory and scrutiny at a high point in his time on the 49ers sideline, Kyle Shanahan cooked up his best game plan of the season. The result was a blowout of the rival Rams that may serve as a turning point for whatâs been one of the NFLâs most disappointing teams. Jimmy Garoppolo continued to build on his recent run of strong play, and Deebo Samuel delivered another All-Pro-level performance for the Niners, who won at Leviâs Stadium for the first time in 393 days. This was a complete effort by San Francisco, which needed just one stellar night to re-establish itself as a player in the NFC postseason race ."
2021,11,18,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-3-1,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Steelers played down to the level of their opponent on Sunday, and it cost them what should have been an easy win at Heinz Field. With Ben Roethlisberger at home following a positive COVID-19 test , Mason Rudolph and the rest of the Steelers bumbled their way to a 16-16 tie against the winless Lions. Rookie tight end Pat Freiermuth fumbled near the Detroit sideline with eight seconds left, denying Pittsburgh the chance at a potential game-winning (and face-saving) field goal. Big Benâs availability for this week is in doubt , and it was revealed Monday that star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick has also landed on the COVID-19 list . The Steelers are being challenged right now."
2021,11,19,Carolina Panthers,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 25 Cam Newton is back and scoring touchdowns, Christian McCaffrey is healthy and living in the second level of defenses, and the Panthers are once again a credible NFC playoff contender . Newton had a surprise supporting role in Week 10, accounting for two touchdowns and a downfield pass that resulted in a defensive pass interference call in a 34-10 win over the Cardinals. Coach Matt Rhule said Monday that Newton will work with the first-team offense this week in practice, a sure sign the former MVP will replace P.J. Walker as starter on Sunday against Washington . This all remains a bit, well, weird considering the circumstances that led to Newton's exit from Charlotte -- but Rhule and Panthers brass deserve some credit for putting the greater good ahead of pride."
2021,11,20,Las Vegas Raiders,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 Is it happening again? Raiders fans hoped this season would be different than the two that preceded it, but Sunday nightâs 41-14 loss to the Chiefs felt like a harbinger of doom. In Week 9 , the offense faltered on the road against the Giants. In prime time at Allegiant Stadium on Sunday night, it was the defense that faltered against a version of Patrick Mahomes that Silver & Black fans hoped was staying in witness protection. At 5-4, the Raiders remain in the thick of the AFC West race, but itâs fair to wonder if Vegas and the rest of the division had its chance to run away and hide from the Chiefs ... and squandered it. Ready or not, here they come ."
2021,11,21,Philadelphia Eagles,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 26 If the Eagles go on to make a dash to the playoffs (not a pipe dream in the wide-open NFC Wild Card race ), we might point to Darius Slay âs 83-yard fumble return as the seasonâs turning point. On the final play of the third quarter, Slay scooped up Melvin Gordon âs fumble, fumbled the ball himself, then recovered and dashed nearly untouched to the end zone to silence the fans at Mile High and send Philadelphia to its fourth road victory in six tries. With a steadily improving Jalen Hurts under center, the Eagles have a chance to make some noise if their defense can continue to deliver impact plays like we saw from ""Big Play Slay"" on Sunday."
2021,11,22,Seattle Seahawks,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 19 It may be unfair to say Russell Wilson launched a PR assault to celebrate his early return from finger surgery , but it sure felt like the Seahawks quarterback was trying to top Adele for the biggest event on television this weekend. The Return did not go to plan, however: Wilson looked like a shell of himself after the four-week layoff, and the Seahawks were shut out for the first time ever with their star quarterback under center. Wilsonâs passer rating (39.7) was the fourth-lowest of his career, as the offense wasted a strong performance by an improving Seattle defense that held Aaron Rodgers to three points through the first three quarters. The 2021 Seahawks may never find a way to put it all together."
2021,11,23,Denver Broncos,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Broncos came into Week 10 hoping to prove that the previous Sundayâs dominant win over the Cowboys wasnât a fluke -- then they stepped on the field and made all their doubters look smart. Denver delivered a flat and uninspired effort in a 30-13 home loss to the Eagles that showed just how far this team remains from serious contention in the AFC. Teddy Bridgewater played perhaps his worst game as a Bronco, piloting the offense to just one touchdown in five red-zone trips and making an apparent âbusiness decisionâ on the Darius Slay 83-yard fumble return that sealed Denverâs fate. It was a bad look for the quarterback and a bad way for the Broncos to hit the bye week."
2021,11,24,New York Giants,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Giants spent their bye week just trying to get healthy. Injuries have been the story with this team, with critical players on the offense disappearing for large swaths of the season. Running back Saquon Barkley and wide receivers Sterling Shepard , Kenny Golladay and Darius Slayton have each been sidelined for three games or more. Electric rookie wideout Kadarius Toney missed two games. The injury avalanche has muddled the evaluation process of third-year QB Daniel Jones while putting handcuffs on offensive coordinator Jason Garrett, who doesnât need any additional impediments to the job. If any team deserves some âinjury luckâ in the second half, itâs the G-Men."
2021,11,25,Chicago Bears,3-6,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 23 The Bears have disappointed on defense after a fast start, but the news isnât all bad. The team continues to receive superstar play from Roquan Smith , who has fully entrenched himself as one of the best off-ball linebackers in football. Smith was an absolute menace against the Steelers before the bye, recording 12 tackles and one sack in the narrow loss at Heinz Field . He had 93 tackles through Week 9, tied with Seahawks star Bobby Wagner for the most in the NFL. Khalil Mack has been the face of the Bearsâ defense for several years, but heâs no longer the teamâs best player on that side of the ball."
2021,11,26,Washington Football Team,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 28 This was the version of the Washington Football Team that Ron Rivera believed he was taking into battle in September. The defense picked off two Tom Brady passes and held the high-powered Bucs offense under 300 yards, while the offense closed the game out with one of the most impressive drives by any team this season. Taylor Heinicke led Washington on a stunning 19-play, 80-yard touchdown drive that bled more than 10 minutes in the final quarter and removed any chance of Brady riding in to save the day. It would have been a perfect Sunday if not for the terrible news that star pass rusher Chase Young tore his ACL in the game and must undergo reconstructive knee surgery. Just one of those years."
2021,11,27,Atlanta Falcons,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 20 âWe were outcoached and outplayed.â Thereâs not much else Arthur Smith could say after an embarrassing 43-3 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday at Jerrah World. One week after a gritty win over the Saints that gave credence to the thought that Atlanta could be a playoff team, the Falcons looked completely out of their depth against a conference superpower Dallas team that was in a foul mood after its own blowout loss a week earlier . Matt Ryan threw for a measly 117 yards, Cordarrelle Patterson exited with an ankle injury , and the Cowboys scored four consecutive touchdowns in the second quarter to take a 36-3 lead into the tunnel at halftime. It was as demoralizing as a loss gets, but the page turns fast in the NFL. Up next: The surging Patriots on Thursday night ."
2021,11,28,Miami Dolphins,3-7,Previous rank: No. 29 Brian Flores needed that win. Tua needed that win. Dolphins fans needed that win. The 22-10 upset over the Ravens was fun and silly and memorable -- and for reasons that went beyond the greatest touchdown in NFL history that didnât count . Credit Brian Flores and defensive coordinator Josh Boyer for cooking up a high-risk/high-reward game plan that sent waves of pressure at Lamar Jackson to stunningly successful results. The Ravensâ high-flying offense -- which piled up 500 yards on the Vikings four days earlier -- didnât even manage a touchdown until there were four minutes remaining in the game. It was a coaching masterpiece that maximized the abilities of Miamiâs talented secondary. Chefâs kiss.
2021,11,29,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-7,"Previous rank: No. 27 Urban Meyer didnât get a win on Sunday in Indianapolis, but the first-year NFL coach provided more evidence he has stabilized the operation after the self-immolation that marked the early portion of his rookie season. Jacksonville fell behind 17-0 against the Colts but fought back and was in position to potentially win the game before Trevor Lawrence lost a fumble in the final minutes. Led by Josh Allen , Jacksonvilleâs defense is showing signs of improvement, but Meyer and the Jags braintrust must devote significant resources to adding pieces around Lawrence in the offseason. The rookie too often seems to be on an island."
2021,11,30,Detroit Lions,0-8-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 The good news is obvious: The Lions didnât lose on Sunday, which counts as undeniable progress for a team that went into its bye at 0-8. That said, Detroit let another second-half lead slip away and failed to seize the moment when a thoroughly spooked Ryan Santoso badly missed a 48-yard attempt in overtime that would have sent the host Steelers to the locker room in shame. After the game, an exasperated Dan Campbell likened the game -- and his first season as Lions coach, we surmise -- to living in The Twilight Zone , a strange and mysterious place where nothing is quite what it seems. ""We didn't win, but we didn't lose, either,"" Campbell said . ""All you can ask for is improvement and we improved."""
2021,11,31,New York Jets,2-7,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 30 Mike White Mania was fun while it lasted. The backup quarterback was in over his head against the Bills, throwing four interceptions in an ugly performance that will quiet any talk of keeping Zach Wilson on the bench any longer than necessary. The 45-17 loss was also another hideous day for Robert Salehâs defense, which has delivered the worst four-game stretch in the history of the franchise. How bad has it been? The Jets are the first team to allow at least 45 points three times in a four-game span since the 1966 Giants. GM Joe Douglas has so much work to do to return the Jets to respectability, but dedicating serious resources to the defense needs to be at the top of the priority list."
2021,11,32,Houston Texans,1-8,"Previous rank: No. 32 When we look back at the history of the Texans a decade from now, 2021 will be remembered -- if itâs remembered at all -- as the lost season for Houstonâs NFL franchise. The depressing Deshaun Watson saga overshadowed anything that happened on the field from the summer through October, and when that drama was (temporarily) tabled post-trade deadline , all that was left was the worst team in football playing out the string ahead of what could be a massive organizational reboot . The coaches and players live in football purgatory: They exist, but everything about this team feels ephemeral. The wrecking ball is coming. Collect your paychecks and try to compile some decent tape."
2021,12,1,Arizona Cardinals,9-2,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Take a bow, Colt McCoy . The veteran quarterback put on a clinic in his third start in place of Kyler Murray , throwing for 328 yards and two touchdowns while leading the Cardinals to a 23-13 victory over the fading Seahawks at Lumen Field. The win prompted an existential crisis in Seattle (bonus!) and positioned Arizona alone atop the NFC as it hits a perfectly timed bye week. Murray (ankle) and DeAndre Hopkins (hamstring) now get two more weeks to heal up before a favorable Week 13 matchup against the Bears. McCoy, meanwhile, probably bought himself another three years of lucrative backup work through his performance this month. Good gig."
2021,12,2,Green Bay Packers,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Packers defense that surged to begin the month was nowhere to be seen against the Vikings. Kirk Cousins and Justin Jefferson turned U.S. Bank Stadium into a personal playground, and even a brilliant second half from Aaron Rodgers was unable to stave off a last-second defeat . The Green Bay defense had blown coverages and costly penalties and was unable to make Minnesota pay when Cousins threw the ball up for grabs. Then there were the injuries: Versatile offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins was lost to a season-ending torn ACL , while Rodgers sounded concerned in his postgame press conference talking about his aggravated toe injury. The Packers remain in fine shape, but they'll need to grind their way to the finish line."
2021,12,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 The Bucs were back on their game on Monday night, moving with clinical efficiency on offense and making splash plays on defense en route to an easy win over the Giants that snapped a two-game losing skid. Mike Evans , Chris Godwin and Rob Gronkowski all went over 65 yards receiving, while Tom Brady crossed 300 yards through the air for the fifth time in 10 games this season. Brady spent the final minutes of the blowout on the Bucs' sideline as Blaine Gabbert finished things out -- the ultimate victory formation. The competition jumps up a notch next Sunday with a road matchup against the red-hot Colts ."
2021,12,4,Kansas City Chiefs,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 We thought we were getting an epic shootout between Patrick Mahomes and Dak Prescott . Instead, it was Chris Jones and the rising Chiefs defense that played the starring role in a 19-9 victory over the NFC East leaders. Jones was a wrecking ball, piling up 3.5 sacks, with a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Jones got help in the back end from Charvarius Ward and L'Jarius Sneed , who each registered crucial interceptions of Prescott. The Chiefs' offense managed just 3 points in its final 10 possessions, but the best teams can win a game on either side of the ball. The Chiefs look like a team ready to restore order in the chaotic AFC."
2021,12,5,Dallas Cowboys,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ On the first play from scrimmage, Dak Prescott spotted an open Michael Gallup streaking down the right sideline ... and missed his wideout by 5 yards on an overthrow. It would be the Cowboys' best chance for an explosive play in a humbling 19-9 loss to the Chiefs. Prescott struggled on the big stage, and the Dallas offensive line failed to protect the team's most prized asset. By game's end, Prescott had thrown two interceptions, lost a fumble and was sacked five times. An excellent performance by the defense should have put the team in position to make a huge statement at Arrowhead. Instead, Dallas shrunk in the spotlight, fueling speculation we're watching another Cowboys team that's more sizzle than steak."
2021,12,6,New England Patriots,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Mac Jones has been an upgrade over Cam Newton , but the 2021 Patriots' biggest difference is a defense that has surged during the team's five-game winning streak. In that stretch, New England has given up just 10 points per game, with 12 interceptions against just four touchdown passes. The 2021 version of Matt Ryan was a sitting duck against New England's relentless pass rush, which turned Atlanta's offensive linemen into sentient turnstiles on the way to four sacks and 12 QB hits. Matt Judon stands tall as the leader of this group: The ace free-agent signing is up to 10.5 sacks in what's been an All-Pro worthy season. The Pats matched their 2020 win total by Thanksgiving and have found themselves in first place as a result."
2021,12,7,Buffalo Bills,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The alarm bell has been sounded in Western New York -- and rightfully so. The Colts came to town and made themselves at home on Sunday, dominating the Bills in all three phases of a 41-15 blowout victory . Jonathan Taylor scored five touchdowns and gained 185 of Indy's 264 rushing yards, the most surrendered by a Buffalo defense in three years. Josh Allen and the offense weren't much better: The quarterback threw two interceptions and fumbled once as the Bills' attack continued to look average when the Jets aren't prominently involved . Now a second-place team, Buffalo will be under the microscope on Thanksgiving night in New Orleans ."
2021,12,8,Tennessee Titans,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Nothing should really be considered stunning in the NFL this season, but there weren't many people who predicted the Titans' impressive winning streak would be snapped at home at the hands of the Texans. Ryan Tannehill threw four interceptions in the 22-13 setback and increasingly appeared like a man alone on an island once A.J. Brown joined Julio Jones and Derrick Henry on the list of unavailable offensive stars. Tennessee has shown no hints of mounting a sustainable offense since Henry went on the shelf after foot surgery three weeks ago. This all feels like terrible timing for a game against the red-hot Patriots, but Mike Vrabel's Titans have a habit of overcoming the odds."
2021,12,9,Los Angeles Rams,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 If the Rams are the type of team that gains motivation from the doubts of others, well, last week's bye might have been a very productive week. Los Angeles was bullied by more physical teams in blowout losses to the Titans and 49ers , framing a narrative that the Rams might not have the necessary toughness to become champions. This all feels like overcooked nonsense, but Sean McVay's team needs to go out and show it won't be pushed around. Meanwhile, Odell Beckham Jr. 's presence went from luxury to necessity after the season-ending injury to Robert Woods . Beckham hasn't performed like a star in years -- Los Angeles is now in the uncomfortable position of needing the mercurial wide receiver to successfully crank back the clock."
2021,12,10,Minnesota Vikings,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Vikings are the most unpredictable and -- maybe -- most dangerous team in the NFC. Kirk Cousins threw three more touchdown passes, including two to the unstoppable Justin Jefferson , in a 34-31 win over the Packers that served as notice to the rest of the league: When the Vikings are humming like they are right now, they can beat anyone. It came down to a final-second field goal by Greg Joseph , because, well, that's the only way the team seems to know how to play. It appears to be taking a toll on the head coach: ""Sundays are not fun,"" said the lovably cantankerous Mike Zimmer. ""You know how they say Sunday is fun day? It's not ... at all."""
2021,12,11,Los Angeles Chargers,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Chargers were ready to Charger in a profound way ... until Justin Herbert stepped in. The brilliant second-year quarterback saved the day with a 53-yard touchdown pass to Mike Williams that thwarted a furious Steelers rally and allowed the Bolts to escape with a 41-37 win on Sunday Night Football . The fourth quarter unfolded in ways both unique and deeply familiar if you're a Chargers fan; it felt as if a meltdown in front of 40,000 Steelers fans invading Southern California was preordained. But Herbert is different . He makes the Chargers different. He accounted for 472 total yards and three touchdowns -- and, even more impressively, showed unshakable cool when the world was on fire. He's a franchise quarterback in every way."
2021,12,12,Indianapolis Colts,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 15 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ On the most exhilarating day in what's become an increasingly interesting Colts season, Jonathan Taylor announced himself as an MVP contender. The dynamic running back was brilliant in the freezing rain of Buffalo, accounting for 204 yards and five touchdowns in a 41-15 statement win over the supposed conference superpower from Western New York. Taylor now leads all running backs in rushing yards and touchdowns, and he's gone over 100 total yards in eight consecutive games. He's the best Colts running back since peak Edgerrin James ; he might be the best running back in the NFL, period. After surviving a 1-4 start, the Colts look like one of the most dangerous teams in the unpredictable AFC."
2021,12,13,Baltimore Ravens,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 10 With Lamar Jackson once again out with an illness, Tyler Huntley did his job. The backup quarterback completed a huge 29-yard pass to Sammy Watkins to set up the go-ahead touchdown in the final minute and knock off the upset-minded Bears at Soldier Field . That late touchdown removed the goat horns from cornerback Chris Westry , who bit on a double move and was beaten on a 49-yard touchdown strike from Andy Dalton that put Baltimore behind with less than two minutes to play. The Ravens are getting by on guts right now: Marquise Brown joined Jackson as an inactive on Sunday, while 15 players are parked on injured reserve. Survive and advance."
2021,12,14,Cleveland Browns,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Where would the Browns be without Nick Chubb ? The star running back returned from a one-game COVID-19-related absence and ran for 130 yards with a receiving touchdown in a 13-10 win over the hapless Lions. Now, the drama: Baker Mayfield struggled through four quarters, walked off the field immediately upon the game's conclusion, then left the stadium without speaking to reporters . Mayfield is banged up and not playing well, but his postgame behavior only draws more attention to his struggles. With the playoffs in sight, could Kevin Stefanski flirt with the idea of turning to Case Keenum down the stretch? Sunday night's matchup against the Ravens will be critical on multiple levels."
2021,12,15,Cincinnati Bengals,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals emerged from their bye and collected the most important win of their season. The 32-13 victory over Las Vegas wasn't exactly a work of art, but Cincinnati stifled the fading Raiders on defense and did enough on offense to snap a two-game losing streak. Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase got back on the same page with a touchdown connection , but the star of the game might have been rookie kicker Evan McPherson , who drilled three field goals from beyond 50 yards in a Tuckerian performance by the fifth-round pick. We'll need to see more from the Bengals to feel confident they're ready for a playoff push in the wide-open AFC, but this was a start."
2021,12,16,San Francisco 49ers,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 17 The 49ers are on the rise. Jimmy Garoppolo threw two touchdown passes for the third consecutive game, and Kyle Shanahan's creative use of do-it-all star Deebo Samuel produced another touchdown in a 30-10 win over the Jaguars. San Francisco has now won back-to-back games in decisive fashion, setting up a huge Week 12 showdown with the surging Vikings. The Niners remain deadly in the red zone: Their 77.8 percent TD conversion mark leads the NFL by a significant margin. Ironically, San Fran's most memorable drive on Sunday -- a 20-play, 13-minute marathon -- ended with a piddly field goal. ""I wanted to go for it bad,"" Shanahan said. According to ESPN , it was the longest drive in 20 years."
2021,12,17,Philadelphia Eagles,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 21 Jalen Hurts is playing himself into the Eagles' future. The second-year quarterback accounted for three touchdowns on Sunday -- all of them on the ground -- in a 40-29 win over the Saints at the Linc. After the game, Nick Sirianni spoke glowingly of Hurts' multidimensional abilities. ""Jalen is a special player who forces defenses to play different,"" the coach said. The victory was also one of personal significance to Sirianni, who finally has his first win at home in five tries as coach. The Eagles have turned into a great cold-weather team: They run the ball extremely well and beat up the opposition in the trenches. There's more work to be done, but they profile as a player in the NFC wild-card race."
2021,12,18,New Orleans Saints,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Saints are now winless in three straight games since Jameis Winston 's exit with a season-ending knee injury, and injuries across the roster have turned Sean Payton's team ordinary and vulnerable. New Orleans played without running back Alvin Kamara and tackles Terron Armstead and Ryan Ramczyk on Sunday, paying the price in an ugly 40-29 loss to the Eagles. Trevor Siemian threw two gross interceptions -- one returned for a score -- and did most of his producing after the game was out of hand. Could Payton turn the starting job over to Taysom Hill ? The team needs a spark, something Hill has been known to provide."
2021,12,19,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-4-1,"Previous rank: No. 18 An undermanned Steelers team showed serious fight on Sunday night. Down 27-10 in the fourth quarter of a quasi-home game in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh staged a furious rally to take the lead before faltering in the final minutes of a 41-37 loss to the Chargers. The game slipped away on a busted coverage that allowed Mike Williams to score the go-ahead 53-yard touchdown with 2:09 to play. NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth correctly asserted that Williams never gets that opportunity if star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (COVID-19) is on the field. The Steelers desperately need to get healthy on defense if they hope to sneak back into the playoffs. Make-or-break divisional matchups against the Bengals and Ravens await."
2021,12,20,Carolina Panthers,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 19 ï»¿ï»¿ Cam Newton played well in his return to Bank of America Stadium, but it was his former backup who stole the show. Taylor Heinicke lit up the Carolina defense for three touchdown passes and the Panthers' offense sputtered for much of the second half in a 27-21 loss , Carolina's fourth consecutive setback at home. Newton ran for a touchdown and threw for two scores, but Carolina's defense was unable to make key stops on a pair of Washington field-goal drives in the final five minutes. The Panthers will look to get back to .500 with a Week 12 matchup against the surging Dolphins ."
2021,12,21,Washington Football Team,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 26 Washington doesnât have the most talented quarterback in the league, but Taylor Heinicke plays the position like the whole world is against him. Heinicke was emotional and fearless in a 27-21 win over the Panthers, throwing three touchdown passes to outshine Cam Newton in the former MVPâs return to Bank of America Stadium . Heinicke made big throws all afternoon, sending a message to the same Panthers team that deemed him expendable on cutdown day two years earlier. Washington can check into the NFC playoff race in earnest with a win over the Seahawks on Monday night ."
2021,12,22,Las Vegas Raiders,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 20 Theyâve done it again. After sucking in fans with a strong start to the season, the Raiders are in a spiral that continued with Sundayâs dispiriting 32-13 loss to the Bengals at Allegiant Stadium. The three-game slide can be traced back to an offense that hasnât been the same since returning from the Week 8 bye. Vegas was 1-for-7 on third-down conversions and managed just 278 total yards against a Cincinnati defense that had been hemorrhaging yards and points in recent weeks. The absence of Henry Ruggs III is impossible to overlook, but the struggles extend beyond one player. A Thanksgiving matchup against the Cowboys has a make-or-break feel to it for the Silver and Black. Said Derek Carr after Sunday's loss: âNo oneâs coming to save us, so we better figure it out.â"
2021,12,23,Denver Broncos,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 23 Itâs dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again for Teddy Bridgewater . The veteran quarterback will come out the bye and enter the final stretch of another regular season attempting to convince his team that heâs more than a one-year patch. He wasnât able to do that last year with the Panthers, and heâll have to show more over the final seven games to convince the Broncos he should be part of their 2022 plans. Bridgewater is liked and well-respected in his locker room and around league circles, but the free agent-to-be might be looking for his fifth team next spring if he canât deliver a surge in play that ignites a Denver playoff run."
2021,12,24,Miami Dolphins,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 28 Credit Brian Flores and the coaching staff for pulling the Dolphins out of a nosedive. The 24-17 victory over the Jets on Sunday at the Meadowlands was Miamiâs third win in a row after the seven-game losing streak that ruined their season. Tua Tagovailoa threw two touchdown passes, including a 65-yard scoring strike , in the latest meeting between downtrodden AFC East rivals. That lone play of more than 30 yards made up for an otherwise sleepy attack that managed just 4.9 yards per play on all other snaps against a wretched New York defense. Tuaâs final six weeks represents the biggest subplot to track in Miami: Heâll need to light it up to pull the Dolphins out of the Deshaun Watson market . Does he have it in him?"
2021,12,25,New York Giants,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Giants finally got most of their playmakers back on the field at the same time on Monday night, but the same issues continued to plague the Jason Garrett-run offense in a 30-10 loss to the Bucs. New York moved the ball well at times, but repeatedly faltered in critical situations. When New York needed to make some plays to get back into the game in the second half, Daniel Jones threw a pair of interceptions to remove any semblance of tension from the affair. A prime-time road matchup against the defending champs is a tall order for any team, but the Giants desperately needed a performance that would jump-start their season. Didn't happen. UPDATE: The New York Giants fired offensive coordinator Jason Garrett on Tuesday, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported."
2021,12,26,Seattle Seahawks,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ The Seahawks are off to their worst 10-game start of the Pete Carroll era (since 2010), and the veteran coach was at a loss for words following the 23-13 loss to the Colt McCoy -led Cardinals at Lumen Field. ""I'm just not any good at this. I'm not prepared for this,"" Carroll said of the struggles. ""I'm struggling to do a good job of coaching when you get your butt kicked week in and week out."" Carroll sounded like a frustrated coach who knows his job security might be in doubt for the first time in his distinguished run in Seattle. The offense is broken and the Seahawks don't currently have a first-round pick in 2022 . This is the great unknown."
2021,12,27,Chicago Bears,3-7,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 25 If the Bears can't find a way to beat a decimated Ravens team playing without Lamar Jackson , it's unclear how many more victories they'll find from here on out. Andy Dalton replaced an injured Justin Fields and threw two touchdown passes, including the dramatic would-be game-winner to Marquise Goodwin with 1:41 to play. But the Bears' defense flatlined when it mattered most, allowing Tyler Huntley to march Baltimore 72 yards to the game-winning score in the final minute. Bears fans were calling for Matt Nagy's firing during the game -- it seems increasingly likely they could get their wish soon enough."
2021,12,28,Atlanta Falcons,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 27 Hope for the 2021 season is officially in short supply after a 25-0 home loss to the Patriots in prime time . Over a humbling five-day span, the Falcons were outscored 68-3 in setbacks to the Pats and Cowboys -- blowouts that reaffirmed Atlantaâs also-ran status and should prompt introspection about where this team is and what it wants to be moving forward. On that subject: The combination of a shoddy offensive line and an aging, increasingly immobile quarterback is killing the Falcons when they face opponents with a strong pass rush. Matt Ryan is a former MVP and the greatest passer in franchise history, but itâs looking more and more apparent a fresh start is needed for both sides."
2021,12,29,Houston Texans,2-8,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans are so much more watchable when Tyrod Taylor is on the field. The veteran quarterback piloted the Houston offense with some level of efficiency and scored twice on the ground in a 22-13 win over the Titans that counts as one of the biggest upsets of the year. The Texans intercepted four Ryan Tannehill passes and made big plays at several crucial junctures despite being out-gained 420-190 in total yards. Now, the bad news: The win, combined with another Lions loss, puts Houston 1.5 games behind Detroit in the âraceâ for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Sometimes you win and still lose."
2021,12,30,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-8,"Previous rank: No. 29 The Jaguars showed signs of life in recent weeks, but the team didn't have much of a pulse in a 30-10 home loss to the 49ers . The playmaker-deficient offense continues to put rookie Trevor Lawrence in difficult positions -- especially against a fast-improving team like San Francisco. Lawrence's hugely hyped debut season in the NFL hasn't delivered the fireworks the Jags had hoped for: He has just eight touchdown passes in 356 attempts and his QBR of 35.0 places him 29th among qualified starters. The guy needs help."
2021,12,31,New York Jets,2-8,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 31 The Jets are losing every week, but letâs focus on the positive: The 2021 draft class has a chance to be a real winner. Elijah Moore went off for 141 yards and a touchdown against the Dolphins and is now living up to the training camp hype. Michael Carter is a keeper at running back and Alijah Vera-Tucker has been a quality starter at guard. Of course, the true measure of the class will come down to whether Zach Wilson is the real deal at quarterback. If Wilson returns from injury and has a promising finish to his rocky rookie year, we might remember this class as a Joe Douglas masterpiece that changed the direction of a previously lost franchise."
2021,12,32,Detroit Lions,0-9-1,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Lions will take the field on Thanksgiving as a winless team for the third time in franchise history. Detroit fought hard in a 13-10 loss to the Browns, but extreme effort that ends in defeat is the type of Groundhog Day outcome that must wear on a locker room when it happens over three straight months. D'Andre Swift has been a bright spot, but itâs clear the Lions donât have their future quarterback currently on the roster. Tim Boyle did very little in his opportunity to start in place of an injured Jared Goff , and David Blough âs third-string status is a damning indictment of his own place in the NFL firmament. Just win (one), baby."
2021,13,1,Green Bay Packers,9-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 Aaron Rodgers was limping around Lambeau Field by the end of Sunday's win over the Rams, but a bum pinkie toe is the extent of the bad news around Green Bay these days. The Packers dressed down the ""all in"" Rams and hit the bye at 9-3, a mark that gives them a commanding lead in the NFC North and leaves them just a half-game behind the top-seeded Cardinals, whom they have the head-to-head tiebreaker over, thanks to their Week 8 win . On Sunday, Green Bay got key contributions from Rasul Douglas ( the game-icing pick-six ), Randall Cobb (95 yards and a touchdown before he left at halftime with a groin injury) and A.J. Dillon , who out-touched Aaron Jones despite the latter's return from a knee injury. This is a deep and talented team."
2021,13,2,Arizona Cardinals,9-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ General manager Steve Keim deserves a bonus star in his eventual end-of-year evaluation for the Zach Ertz trade. The Cardinals acquired the three-time Pro Bowl tight end from the Eagles in exchange for rookie sixth-rounder Tay Gowan and a 2022 fifth-round pick , and Ertz has already earned back that investment and then some. Ertz has stepped into a playmaker role in five games in Arizona, collecting 22 catches for 269 yards and three touchdowns -- two of them coming in the Week 11 win over the Seahawks . His presence has been especially vital at a time when injuries have knocked Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins out of the lineup. Don't be surprised when Ertz is making big catches in the playoffs. He's been known to do that ."
2021,13,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 Leonard Fournette was seen as a complementary piece when he landed with the Bucs just before last season kicked off. Cut to the present, and the running back has turned himself into a vital part of what Tampa Bay does. Fournette accounted for four of the Bucs' five touchdowns on Sunday, including the go-ahead 28-yard run in the final minute of a 38-31 comeback win over the Colts. Not bad for a former first-round pick who was cut by the Jags after three seasons of decent production and repeated clashes with coaching and management. On Sunday, Fournette rushed for 100 yards on 17 carries with seven catches for 31 yards, and he added an emotional halftime speech that Bucs teammates credited with sparking Tampa's second-half surge. Tom Coughlin just spit out his drink."
2021,13,4,Kansas City Chiefs,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 Led by Chris Jones , the Chiefs piled up five sacks in their Week 11 win over Cowboys. It was a nice change of pace for the Kansas City defense, which entered the day with just 14 sacks in its first 10 games. Jones is the unquestioned star of the unit, but Steve Spagnuolo now has a collection of seasoned pass rushers to do his bidding. In Jones, Jarran Reed , Melvin Ingram and Frank Clark , the Chiefs now deploy four players in their front seven who have registered a 10-sack season in their respective careers. If they can continue to cook up pressure on the quarterback, good things will continue to happen."
2021,13,5,New England Patriots,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 The win streak has reached six games for the Patriots after a wipeout of the undermanned Titans. Mac Jones fared well in his first cold-weather outing at Foxborough, but it was the defense that once again played the starring role for New England. The Pats forced four turnovers, including an end-zone pick by cornerback J.C. Jackson , who also had a crucial forced fumble when the game remained in doubt. Said Bill Belichick after the win: ""You leave any trash laying around, he's going to pick it up."" The Pats have announced themselves as a player in the AFC, but a challenging three-game stretch that includes two matchups against the Bills will give us a greater understanding of where this team stands."
2021,13,6,Buffalo Bills,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bills went to New Orleans on Thanksgiving night and overwhelmed an injury-decimated Saints team, an important bounce-back win for a team on the edge of crisis after a blowout loss to the Colts four days earlier. The news wasn't all good, however: one-time All-Pro cornerback Tre'Davious White went down with a non-contact left knee injury later diagnosed as a season-ending ACL tear . This Bills season will be defined, in part, by how Sean McDermott can pivot and adapt without his most important player on defense. You can imagine Bill Belichick is already scheming ways to attack the White-free Buffalo D with a huge divisional showdown up next ."
2021,13,7,Cincinnati Bengals,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 Sunday felt like a changing-of-the-guard day in the AFC North. After years of Steelers dominance, it's now the Bengals who have emerged as the more talented, more physical, more promising team. That was on clear display during the Bengals' 41-10 win at celebratory Paul Brown Stadium, the second Cincinnati blowout of Pittsburgh this season in what feels like a role reversal with potential long-term legs. Joe Burrow had four incompletions across 24 attempts, Mike Hilton delivered the game-clinching pick-six to extend Cincy's lead to 31-3 at halftime, and Joe Mixon 's big season continued with 165 rushing yards, the most ever for a Bengals back against the Steelers. Times, they are a changin'."
2021,13,8,Dallas Cowboys,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 The Cowboys have lost three of four after a 6-1 start and feel like a team taking on water. Injuries have played a major role in the slump: Amari Cooper (COVID-19), Tyron Smith (ankle) and CeeDee Lamb (concussion) have all missed time, while Ezekiel Elliott has a lingering knee issue that could limit him the rest of the way. It has made the Dallas attack less formidable, and even the week-to-week excellence of Micah Parsons has been unable to sustain a defense that's missed DeMarcus Lawrence (foot) and Randy Gregory (calf). The bad news continued to roll in on Monday, when it was learned that coach Mike McCarthy and several others will miss Thursday night's game against the Saints after entering the NFL's COVID-19 protocols ."
2021,13,9,Baltimore Ravens,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 13 Lamar Jackson threw four interceptions in a game and the Ravens beat a division rival. That says something about John Harbaugh's team (and, specifically, his defense), which picked up its quarterback time and time again in a 16-10 win over the Browns on Sunday night. The Ravens stacked the box to neutralize Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt , daring Baker Mayfield to beat them downfield. The strategy worked, as Mayfield completed less than half of his 37 attempts and managed just one (borderline) touchdown pass . ""Defense was just off the charts,"" Harbaugh said after the win. ""That's one of the best defensive performances that we've seen out here in a long time."""
2021,13,10,San Francisco 49ers,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 16 The 49ers received huge contributions from unexpected places in a gutty win over the Vikings. Azeez Al-Shaair was a star at linebacker , first on the weak side and then in the middle calling plays once Fred Warner went out with a hamstring injury. Elijah Mitchell , playing with that steel pin in his finger, piled up 133 yards and a touchdown. And when Deebo Samuel was lost to a groin injury, it was Trent Sherfield who stepped up with a huge third-down catch that allowed San Francisco to burn precious seconds in the final quarter. The victory moved the Niners into playoff position in the NFC and reaffirmed what's become increasingly apparent as the month has progressed: Kyle Shanahan's team has found itself and is ready to make some noise."
2021,13,11,Los Angeles Rams,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 9 Jalen Ramsey admitted after the Rams' third straight loss, a marginally competitive 36-28 defeat to the Packers, that he's shocked by his team's November swoon. ""Of course I am,"" the star corner said. ""We have guys that are way too good for us to be losing games like this and losing games on the road."" Odell Beckham caught a long touchdown pass in his second game with L.A., but Von Miller has yet to make an impact -- in fact, the Rams are winless since pulling the trigger on the Miller deal that prompted their increasingly awkward ""all in"" tweet . A Sunday home matchup with the Jaguars should provide cover, but nothing is to be assumed for a team that's lost its last three games by an average of 13.7 points."
2021,13,12,Tennessee Titans,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 8 The Titans can't seem to stop the bleeding right now. Mike Vrabel's team turned the ball over four times in Sunday's 36-13 loss to the Patriots, a level of sloppiness that simply won't play for an injury-wracked team working with such a small margin for error. Ryan Tannehill continued to struggle without his promised complement of weapons, but there was good news in the form of a running game that piled up 270 yards against New England's stout defense. It was the first time the ground attack has shown life since Derrick Henry hit injured reserve. The Week 13 bye comes at an opportune time for a team that desperately needs to get healthy."
2021,13,13,Indianapolis Colts,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 12 What a deeply disappointing outcome on Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts had a 10-point second-half lead over the defending Super Bowl champions and the opportunity to close within one game of the division-leading Titans. Then, disaster struck. Shaq Barrett's strip-sack and fumble recovery sparked a Bucs comeback and was part of an avalanche of mistakes by the Colts, who piled up five turnovers in a 38-31 loss . Criticism over Frank Reich's reluctance to lean on Jonathan Taylor in the second half is warranted, but this loss went beyond the usage of the team's electric running back. The Colts had the chance to deliver a huge statement win and make the AFC South race incredibly interesting -- and blinked."
2021,13,14,Minnesota Vikings,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Vikings have shown they can beat anyone in the NFL when they're on top of their game ... but consistency continues to elude Mike Zimmer's team. The Vikes jumped out to another seven-point lead on Sunday -- they've done that in every game this season -- but still found themselves on the wrong side of a one-score loss to the Niners, who now possess a potentially critical head-to-head tiebreaker in the race for a wild-card bid in the NFC. The injury news is bad, as well: Dalvin Cook was carted off with a shoulder injury and diagnosed Monday with a dislocation and torn labrum. Alexander Mattison is a quality backup, but an extended absence on Cook's part will have a trickle-down effect on the entire operation."
2021,13,15,Los Angeles Chargers,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 11 The same issues continue to crop up for the Chargers, who have lost four of six after their latest setback to the Broncos. The defense can't stop the run or make game-changing plays, and the offense is painfully inconsistent. The Bolts continued their trend of playing poorly after a win, and an offensive line compromised by injuries has been exposed by a roll call of veteran defensive-minded coaches. Justin Herbert isn't blameless: He missed open receivers and threw two costly interceptions, but the talented second-year QB isn't getting enough help. After a 4-1 start to the season, the Chargers have looked like an average team. This just might be what they are."
2021,13,16,Cleveland Browns,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 14 First, it was Odell Beckham Sr. sounding off on Baker Mayfield . On Sunday night, it was Kareem Hunt 's old man who went public with his opinion that the Browns are incapable of running their offense with a physically compromised starting quarterback. Mr. Hunt makes a fair point: Mayfield deserves credit for gutting through multiple injuries, but he's not making enough plays to justify his continued inclusion in the lineup. In Case Keenum , the Browns have a highly qualified ( and well-compensated ) backup who once nearly took the Vikings to the Super Bowl with Kevin Stefanski as his quarterback coach. Yes, benching Mayfield could lead to hurt feelings and possible estrangement, but if winning football games is the top priority? It's time."
2021,13,17,Las Vegas Raiders,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 22 How huge does the DeSean Jackson signing look right now? The veteran speedster started the scoring in a huge Thanksgiving win over the Cowboys with a 56-yard touchdown and was a key factor throughout the 36-33 overtime thriller at Jerrah World. The stunning departure of Henry Ruggs III left a huge hole in the Vegas attack, but Jackson possesses the skill set to fill it -- if he can stay on the field. Derek Carr threw for 373 yards thanks to connections with Jackson, but also because of the portions of the field that were opened up by Vegas' deep-strike ability. ""(Jon) Gruden used to tell me, don't ever take your arm out of a game,"" Carr said. ""So when we call these things, let's rip 'em."""
2021,13,18,Miami Dolphins,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 24 This was the Dolphins team we expected to see. The defense is humming and the offense is on the rise, with young Tua Tagovailoa healthy and efficient under center. Tua finally reached the 16-start mark in Sunday's 33-10 win over the Panthers, and his career numbers may surprise you: 67 percent completion rate, 3,515 yards, 27 total touchdowns, 12 turnovers and a 90.5 passer rating. That's the production of an above-average starter, and given his age (23) and limited experience, one can reasonably expect the former first-round pick to continue to improve. Deshaun Watson to the Dolphins has sometimes felt like a fait accompli, but Tua can flip the script with a strong close to the season."
2021,13,19,Denver Broncos,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 23 When the Broncos traded Von Miller to the Rams, it signaled the start of a new era for the defense. The kids were alright in Sunday's 28-13 win over the Chargers. Denver heavily featured four rookies on defense and harassed Justin Herbert into three sacks, 10 QB hits and two interceptions. Both picks came courtesy of first-year corner Pat Surtain II ; one snagged in the end zone with the Chargers looking for the tying score, the other a pick-six that effectively put the game on ice. At 6-5, the Broncos have the chance to move into a first-place tie in the AFC West with a win over the division-leading Chiefs on Sunday Night Football . This Broncos relevance snuck up on you, didn't it?"
2021,13,20,Washington Football Team,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 21 Newsflash out of Washington: The Football Team is alive and well. The winning streak is up to three after a 17-15 victory over the Seahawks, a prime-time conquest that moved Washington into the seventh seed in the NFC playoffs and brought them within shouting distance (two games back) of the slumping Cowboys in the NFC East. Washington beat the Seahawks by using Ron Rivera's most beloved formula: Run the football and play stout defense. Washington's defense forced Seattle into five consecutive three-and-outs at one point, leading to over 41 minutes of possession time for Taylor Heinicke and Co. Washington isn't the most talented team ... but it believes."
2021,13,21,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 19 After years -- decades, really -- of battling it out with the Ravens while beating up on bumbling also-rans in Cleveland and Cincinnati, the tables have turned. There are no more gimmes for Pittsburgh. The Bengals reminded them of that in the rudest way imaginable on Sunday, building a 31-3 halftime lead before coasting to a 41-10 win to complete a punishing season sweep. The Steelers are plainly, painfully ordinary: They have a defense that is typically good but rarely great, and a middling offense led by a veteran quarterback who looks ready for the exit door. A playoff push is still within reason, given the wide-open nature of this NFL season, but the true reality here is impossible to ignore."
2021,13,22,Philadelphia Eagles,5-7,"Previous rank: No.  17 The Eagles' momentum fluttered away in the winds of the Meadowlands. Jalen Hurts threw three interceptions, Boston Scott had a costly fumble and Jalen Reagor missed two opportunities to play hero in the final minute of a grim 13-7 loss to the Giants. Reagor let two well-placed Hurts passes clang off his hands near the goal line -- tough catches, sure, but balls that a player drafted one spot ahead of Justin Jefferson is expected to come down with. Hurts wasn't blameless: The second-year QB tried to force the action too often and threw the ball up for grabs in multiple instances, with calamitous results. The league's easiest closing schedule will help the Eagles in their push for the playoffs, but Sunday's preventable loss could haunt them."
2021,13,23,New York Giants,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 25 The dismissal of Jason Garrett did little to help the Giants' offense, which remained abysmal Sunday against the Eagles. Luckily, the defense had a better time of it against Philly, forcing four turnovers and (with some Jalen Reagor -related luck) getting the final stop in a 13-7 win at the Meadowlands. Hard as it may be to believe, the Giants remain on the periphery of the NFC wild-card race, though it would take a miraculous turnaround from the offense to end the team's five-year playoff drought. One player who benefitted from Freddie Kitchens' ascension to play-caller was Kenny Golladay , who garnered two end-zone targets (both unsuccessful) and converted a pair of 18-yard completions on New York's final field-goal drive. It's a start."
2021,13,24,Carolina Panthers,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 20 Week 12 represented a doomsday scenario for the 2021 Panthers. Consider the setbacks in a 33-10 loss to the Dolphins: Cam Newton imploded with a career-worst performance that once again led to Matt Rhule answering questions about who will be his starting quarterback moving forward. The defense -- the supposed bedrock of this team -- got pushed around for the second straight week. And then there's Christian McCaffrey , who suffered another injury -- this time to his ankle -- deemed severe enough to end his season . CMC has now lost back-to-back years of his prime to assorted ailments. The Panthers have to face some hard truths this offseason, including the wisdom of building an offense around a supremely talented but injury-prone running back."
2021,13,25,New Orleans Saints,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 18 The bottom has fallen out for the Saints. Playing without Alvin Kamara for a third consecutive week, New Orleans managed just 44 rushing yards (1.8 yards per carry) and 190 total yards in a ghastly 31-6 setback to the Bills at the Superdome. Thatâs four straight losses for the Saints, who have simply sustained too many personnel losses to operate as an efficient offense. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday that Sean Payton appears ready to change quarterbacks , and it makes sense: Trevor Siemian is a born journeyman, and logic dictates the team take an extended look at Taysom Hill before making some very important decisions in the offseason. At the very least, Hill provides some juice to an attack that could use it."
2021,13,26,Seattle Seahawks,3-8,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ It's all over now. The Seahawks had one last chance to pump some life into their cursed season with a prime-time win over the Washington Football Team, but it ended up being more of the same: Russell Wilson struggled with accuracy, Seattle couldn't run the ball, DK Metcalf was entirely detached from the game plan and OC Shane Waldron couldn't make the necessary adjustments in a 17-15 loss . The conversation will now begin to shift to the future: Should Waldron return for a second season? Has Pete Carroll worn out his welcome? Does it make sense to actually entertain trading Wilson away? Does Wilson want to be here? Sleepless in Seattle, indeed."
2021,13,27,Chicago Bears,4-7,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 27 Imagine Matt Nagyâs relief when it was the head coach on the other sideline catching all the heat on Thanksgiving in Detroit. The Lions kicked away another chance at victory by calling back-to-back timeouts in the final minute, a mental miscue that helped the Bears escape with a 16-14 win . It was a week that began with a refuted report that Nagy was coaching for his job in Week 12. Nagy is still here, and itâs likely he will be for the balance of another lost season in Chicago. But the clock is ticking, and it hangs over everything this team will do between now and January."
2021,13,28,Atlanta Falcons,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 28 It wonât be long before this middling Falcons team is consigned to the dustbin of history, rarely to be referenced by future historians of the sport. But Iâll remember Cordarrelle Patterson , and how Arthur Smith helped turn a veteran wide receiver and special teams ace into one of the leagueâs most productive running backs. Patterson was on his game again on Sunday, tallying 135 total yards and two touchdowns in a win over the Jaguars. With Calvin Ridley absent and rookie tight end Kyle Pitts a hit-or-miss contributor, Patterson has been the most dependable aspect of Atlantaâs attack all season. Never forget."
2021,13,29,New York Jets,3-8,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 31 The NFLâs last-ranked defense came alive in the second half against the Texans, holding Houston to just 45 yards and zero points over the final two quarters en route to a 21-14 win . It was a much-needed confidence boost for Robert Salehâs side of the ball, but the Jets had to be less enthused about the play of Zach Wilson , who struggled with accuracy and decision-making in his return to the lineup after missing four weeks with a knee sprain. Credit offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur for cooking up an adjusted game plan that put his QB in the back seat as New York dug out of a 14-3 first-half deficit. Growing pains are always expected with a rookie under center, but Wilsonâs have been especially uncomfortable."
2021,13,30,Houston Texans,2-9,"Previous rank: No. 29 Thereâs no question Tyrod Taylor makes the Texans more competitive on offense, but letâs not mistake basic competence with actual quality. Taylor threw two touchdown passes in the second quarter as Houston took an early 11-point lead on the visiting Jets, but the Texansâ attack went to sleep after that in an eventual 21-14 loss . How bad was the offense after its quick start? The Texans managed just 45 yards in the second half and were unable to score a point in their final seven drives against the leagueâs No. 32-ranked defense. Meanwhile, Justin Reid is still trying to figure out why he didnât play . January 10th canât get here fast enough."
2021,13,31,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-9,"Previous rank: No. 30 Trevor Lawrence has had precious few open receivers to throw to this season, and now heâs lost the only guy who seemed to gain consistent separation on a weekly basis. Tight end Dan Arnold went down with a potentially season-ending knee injury in Sundayâs loss to the Falcons , further emptying the cupboard for Lawrence in whatâs been an extremely frustrating year for the No. 1 overall pick. It will be interesting to see what changes Urban Meyer makes to address the offense in 2022: Offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell is an obvious replacement candidate if Meyer believes the struggles go beyond personnel."
2021,13,32,Detroit Lions,0-10-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Lions find ways to lose. Six holding penalties by the offensive line. A coverage bust on one touchdown. The mind-numbing (and illegal) double timeout that helped doom them in the final minutes. Dan Campbell has his team fighting hard week after week, but itâs not just the players who need to learn how to close out a game. The miscommunications and mental errors reflect poorly on the coaching staff, and when you combine them with a roster bereft of elite talent, well, thatâs how you get to 0-10-1. âThese guys, theyâre fighting their tails off,â Campbell said after Thursday's 16-14 loss to the Bears. âBut until we get out of our own way, we wonât quite get over the hump.â"
2021,14,1,Green Bay Packers,9-3,"Previous rank: No. 1 Aaron Jones returned to the lineup in the Week 12 win over the Rams after missing a week with a knee injury and saw significantly less work than upstart second-year back A.J. Dillon . Was this a case of Green Bay wisely easing its star rusher back onto the field -- or has Dillon shown enough to carve out a legitimate timeshare in the backfield? Jones is too talented as a runner and receiver to take out of the mix, but a 1-2 punch of Jones and Dillon makes the Packers' running game deadly in the same way that Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt are weaponized to close out opponents for the Browns. You know what's better than having The Guy in your backfield? Having two of them."
2021,14,2,Arizona Cardinals,10-2,"Previous rank: No. 2 Kyler Murray returned to action on Sunday and looked like the all-around menace to defenses that he was before an ankle injury put him on the shelf for a month. Murray threw two touchdown passes and rushed for two more in a blowout win over the Bears, showing no limitations in mobility. DeAndre Hopkins -- also back in the lineup after an extended absence -- was the recipient of Murray's first touchdown pass , making Week 13 pretty much a perfect reintroduction for the Cardinals as they came out of their bye week. A win over the Rams next Monday night would put Arizona in the driver's seat for both the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC."
2021,14,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,9-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 Is it Tom Brady 's turn to be the MVP favorite? Brady threw four more touchdown passes on Sunday -- giving him a league-best 34 on the season -- in an easy win over the Falcons that pushed Tampa Bay one step closer to an inevitable NFC South title. Brady opened the game with 13 consecutive pass attempts and completed 38 of 51 passes overall. He remains the unquestioned driver of his offense in his 22nd NFL season, and he's been the best quarterback in football during a year in which the quality of play at the position has been strangely inconsistent. The Bucs don't need balance to their attack when they have the G.O.A.T. at the controls."
2021,14,4,New England Patriots,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 The man's rare sideline smile told the story: This was the kind of night that keeps Bill Belichick in the game. With frigid cold and gusting winds, Belichick took the ball out of his quarterback's hands ( three pass attempts for Mac Jones ) and won with a pounding run attack and a defense that bent but did not break. The 14-10 victory over the Bills pushed the Pats' winning streak to seven games and gave them sole possession of the No. 1 seed in the AFC with five weeks in the regular season. Tom Brady might be gone, but the Pats' continued ability to win contests like this goes right back to the legend in the hoodie on the sideline."
2021,14,5,Kansas City Chiefs,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 This is the new normal. The Chiefs are winning every week because of their defense , not because of Patrick Mahomes and an offense that remains lost in the fog. Penalties, turnovers and a stunning dearth of big plays have come to define Andy Reid's attack, and we're now well past the point where you can look at Kansas City's body of work on offense and call it a slump. This is who the 2021 Chiefs are, and one bad day at the office for Steve Spagnuolo's defense might be all it takes to make the defending conference champions disappear in January. You don't win Super Bowls with a broken offense -- is it even possible to make a fix before the season ends?"
2021,14,6,Dallas Cowboys,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 8 It wasn't a work of art, but the Cowboys got the job done on Thursday night in New Orleans. The defense did the heavy lifting, icing the game with three fourth-quarter interceptions -- including a Carlos Watkins pick-six -- in a 27-17 win that snapped a two-game losing streak. Afterward, Dallas got a much needed ""half-bye"" to rest up and recover before making a push for the top seed in the NFC. The ongoing slump of Dak Prescott remains a situation worth tracking: The quarterback made some elite throws against the Saints, but he has not been as consistent a force since his return from the calf strain that cost him a game."
2021,14,7,Buffalo Bills,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ A challenging Bills season reached new levels of frustration on Monday Night Football in the swirling winds of Orchard Park. The Patriots proved themselves to be the more physical team, repeatedly winning at the line of scrimmage even when the whole stadium knew Mac Jones ' primary job was to turn around and hand the ball off. Josh Allen made good use of his cannon arm, but he also missed key throws and presided over two fourth-quarter drives that stalled in the red zone and ultimately cost Buffalo a game it desperately needed. A rematch at Foxborough looms, but not before a date with Tom Brady and the Bucs . Gut-check time has arrived."
2021,14,8,Los Angeles Rams,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 Ah, if only the Rams could play the Jaguars every Sunday. Los Angeles rolled to a blowout win at Hollywood Park, snapping a three-game losing streak and putting themselves in a more positive headspace, with a Monday night showdown on tap against the first-place Cardinals . The star-laden defense will need to step up in the way it couldn't against the Packers , while the offense needs to find the consistency it had earlier this season. Near the top of the concern list: Will Matthew Stafford and Odell Beckham find chemistry in the home stretch? Beckham has two touchdowns in three games with Los Angeles, but he has yet to make a real impact."
2021,14,9,Indianapolis Colts,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Colts demolish bad teams. Cream them. Grind them into dust. Strike them from the Earth. Banish them to parts unknown. It happened again on Sunday, in a 31-0 win over the moribund Texans that moved Frank Reich's men back over .500 as they reach their bye. When the Colts return to action in Week 15, they'll hit a critical two-game stretch against the Patriots and Cardinals that will define their season. Indy still has just one win against a team with a winning record this season. Is this an actual AFC powerhouse ... or just a middle-of-the-road group that beats up on the have-nots? We'll find out soon enough."
2021,14,10,Los Angeles Chargers,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Chargers flew to Cincinnati to ride a roller coaster. Brandon Staley's team nearly blew a 24-point lead, but a massive touchdown on a fumble recovery by Tevaughn Campbell changed everything in a 41-22 win over the Bengals. It might have been the play of the year for the Bolts, but it wasn't the only promising development to come out of the victory: Justin Herbert and the big-play attack were back after a frustrating sabbatical. Herbert averaged over 9 yards per attempt and showcased his top-shelf arm strength on an absurd 44-yard TD strike to Jalen Guyton in the second quarter. As CBS analyst Charles Davis deftly put it during the telecast: ""That call is not in everyone's playbook."""
2021,14,11,Cincinnati Bengals,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Bengals had a chance for their first three-game winning streak of the season ... and fell on their faces. Hosting the Chargers in front of a fired-up crowd at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincy surrendered the game's first 24 points, mounted a comeback to cut the deficit to 2, then watched a rare Joe Mixon fumble kick-start a final Bolts surge in a 41-22 loss . Injuries are also a concern. Joe Burrow gutted his way through the game after suffering a dislocated pinkie in the first quarter, while starting cornerback Chidobe Awuzie and linebacker Logan Wilson were both knocked out the game with ailments. The AFC North remains there for the taking ... but you never know which version of the Bengals is going to show up."
2021,14,12,Baltimore Ravens,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 9 It's easy to second-guess John Harbaugh's decision to go for that 2-point conversion in what turned out to be a stomach-punch loss to the hated Steelers, but the coach had his reasons. The Ravens' defense had allowed three consecutive scoring drives in the fourth quarter, and a season-ending pec injury suffered by star cornerback Marlon Humphrey on the previous Pittsburgh possession put his secondary in a desperate situation . Baltimore has made its season with clutch plays in the biggest moments of games, so Harbaugh decided to trust his gut on the coaching equivalent of a ""heat check"" by a sharpshooter in basketball. Sure, the ball rimmed out, but you have to respect the moxie."
2021,14,13,Tennessee Titans,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 12 Turnovers have become a major problem for the Titans in recent weeks: They give up too many of them, and they don't generate enough for themselves. Tennessee went into its Week 13 bye with nine combined giveaways and zero takeaways in back-to-back losses to the Texans and Patriots . This, as you probably don't need to be made aware, is perhaps the ultimate recipe for doom in professional football. During a six-game win streak that preceded the Titans' shocking loss to Houston, Tennessee's defense forced 11 turnovers. If the Titans are to snap out of their current funk, they'll need an immense clean-up effort in this area of their game."
2021,14,14,San Francisco 49ers,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 The 49ers suffered their most frustrating loss of the season on Sunday in Seattle, a game that will be remembered for an unending litany of self-inflicted errors. They allowed a 73-yard touchdown on a fake punt run. They fumbled a kick return . They threw two interceptions , and took a sack in the end zone for a safety . They were charged with 10 penalties, including two critical roughing the passer fouls. And even with all that mess, the Niners were 3 yards away from the potential game-tying score when Jimmy Gâs fourth-down pass attempt was batted away in the final seconds . âWe definitely blew it,â Nick Bosa said after the game. ââ¦ We got to do a better job of not giving the game away.â"
2021,14,15,Miami Dolphins,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 18 Tua Tagovailoa throws a good ball. I'm not exactly offering up Baldy's Breakdown -level football discourse here, but you know a talented passer when you see one, and Tua looks the part. The 2020 No. 5 overall pick possesses great touch and accuracy, and his left-handed motion makes him unique in a football world that has moved away from the southpaw QB in recent years. The Dolphins' winning streak is up to five after a 20-9 conquest over the Giants, and Tua's steady hand, combined with Brian Flores' increasingly ferocious defense, is a pairing that could take Miami from 1-7 to the playoffs."
2021,14,16,Cleveland Browns,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 16 Andrew Berry gave the media 30 minutes as the Browns began their much-needed bye week, but the general manager was too smart to offer the press the red meat they craved regarding Baker Mayfield . The former No. 1 pick has struggled through an injury-riddled year, but Berry was careful not to play his hand on how this season has -- or has not -- changed the teamâs internal evaluation of the quarterback. Time remains on Clevelandâs side: Mayfield has one year and nearly $19 million left on his rookie deal, which makes him the likely starter in 2022 regardless of what happens the rest of the way. Mayfield might not be close to the lucrative long-term extension that appeared imminent last summer, but heâs not facing a doomsday scenario, either."
2021,14,17,Washington Football Team,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 20 Taylor Heinicke got away with some mistakes on Sunday, but he also made some key plays in another fourth-quarter comeback for the surging Football Team. A clutch field goal by Brian Johnson -- Washington's fourth kicker this season -- allowed the Football Team to escape with a 17-15 win in Vegas and stay in playoff position in the wide-open NFC. The real star of the game was the revitalized defense, which continues to thrive without several of its best players. Washington stifled a Raiders attack that missed injured tight end Darren Waller , and Derek Carr failed to punish Washington when presented with coverage breakdowns. The Football Team has some juice."
2021,14,18,Pittsburgh Steelers,6-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Steelers' offense found its footing just in time on Sunday, producing 17 points in the fourth quarter of a stirring 20-19 win over the Ravens to keep Pittsburgh's AFC North hopes alive . The Steelers clinched the huge victory when Lamar Jackson âs 2-point conversion pass attempt hit the fingertips of Mark Andrews and fell incomplete with seconds to play. The pass was errant because of pressure from -- you guessed it -- T.J. Watt , who also collected 3.5 sacks and took a commanding lead in the Defensive Player of the Year race. There isnât another non-quarterback in the sport who is as important to his team as Watt is to the Steelers. Forget DPOY, Watt deserves MVP buzz."
2021,14,19,Minnesota Vikings,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Some things we'll just never know: Who built Stonehenge? What became of Amelia Earhart? Why did Cameron Dantzler play 11 yards off the receiver ? The Vikings' latest ridiculous loss could have significant long-term ramifications for the franchise, especially if Minnesota's truly manic season ends with the team one win shy of a playoff berth. The Vikings dug themselves out of a 20-6 hole, only to still find a way to lose to a Lions team that hadn't claimed victory in 364 days. Mike Zimmer's future with the team has never been hazier, and you wonder if more seismic changes are in store once this wildly frustrating season reaches its sure-to-be-absurd conclusion."
2021,14,20,Philadelphia Eagles,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 22 Thereâs a reason why Gardner Minshew's postgame celebration with his father looked like a scene straight out of Friday Night Lights . With Jalen Hurts out with an ankle injury, Minshew was given one start to make an impression -- to plant the seed that he could be The Guy -- and he absolutely nailed his audition. Minshew completed his first 12 passes against the Jets and led Philly on seven consecutive scoring drives in a convincing win that led to the inevitable questions about Hurtsâ job security. Nick Sirianni did a nice job of deflection , but Eagles fans have now caught MinshewMania in the same way Duval County did before them. Minshew is a fun and passionate player, with the underdog charisma of Rocky Balboa. No wonder Iggles fans are head over heels."
2021,14,21,Las Vegas Raiders,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 17 A narrow loss to a surging Washington team is no cause to ring the shame bell, but if the Raiders want to show they are different than the teams that have failed in recent years they have to step up when it matters most. Derek Carr has to hit Foster Moreau and Zay Jones in the red zone. Trevon Moehrig needs to hold on to an errant Taylor Heinicke pass on Washingtonâs final drive. Weâve reached the crucible of the regular season, and the teams who will advance to the playoffs are the teams who seize opportunities and take advantage of their opponentâs mistakes. The Raiders lacked that killer instinct on Sunday in a loss that summoned the ghosts of Decembers past."
2021,14,22,Seattle Seahawks,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Seahawks are not a very good team, but they showed real fight in yet another win over the 49ers . That started early, on a fake punt -- from their own 27-yard line! -- that resulted in a 73-yard touchdown run by Travis Homer . It was the spark Seattle needed and it burned through four quarters of a wild 30-23 win at Lumen Field. At 4-8, the Seahawks are highly unlikely to find their way back into the NFC playoff picture , but this version of Pete Carrollâs team could cause some havoc for contenders down the stretch. Seattle in a spoiler role feels strange for a team that qualified for the playoffs in nine of the past 10 seasons, but weirdness is the modus operandi of this NFL season."
2021,14,23,Denver Broncos,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 19 Sunday nightâs crucial showdown with the Chiefs represented an audition of sorts for Teddy Bridgewater . The veteran quarterback has led a nomadic NFL career, and the SNF stage was a golden opportunity for Bridgewater to announce to this franchise that he can be more than a stopgap option under center in Denver. Unfortunately for Bridgewater, the outcome likely produced the opposite effect. Bridgewater struggled against a stout Kansas City defense, throwing two crucial second-half interceptions -- including a game-sealing pick-six -- in a 22-9 loss . Denverâs offense couldn't deliver in the critical moments on a day the defense all but shut down Patrick Mahomes , and even a 20-play drive in the third quarter failed to produce points. The Broncos are still looking for their difference-maker at QB."
2021,14,24,New York Giants,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 23 This probably won't come as a surprise, but career journeyman Mike Glennon was not the solution to the Giants' season-long offensive funk. Big Blue managed just nine points and 250 total yards in a performance that provided a hint that maybe Jason Garrett wasn't the only problem with one of the worst offenses in football. You know what has been a problem? Saquon Barkley , the former No. 2 overall pick who has been unable to rise above the middling talent around him. Is Barkley trapped in a bad situation -- or is he not the same guy after the reconstructive knee surgery and nagging injuries that have haunted him this season? This is a team that feels like it could be headed toward a hard reboot."
2021,14,25,Carolina Panthers,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Panthers have a Christian McCaffrey conundrum. When this season comes to a conclusion, McCaffrey will have missed 23 of 33 games since signing the contract extension that made him the highest-paid running back in NFL history . Unfortunately for his brethren, McCaffrey has become the latest example of why teams paying running backs big money is bad business. McCaffrey will be back next season, but Matt Rhule and the braintrust ( minus Joe Brady ) will likely use the rest of the season as a barometer in deciding whether Chuba Hubbard is a worthy backup. If you're going to walk the CMC tightrope, you had better have a strong safety net."
2021,14,26,New Orleans Saints,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 25 Taysom Hill added some much-needed excitement to the offense, but the desired result remained elusive for the Saints, who continued their stumble out of the playoff picture in a prime-time loss to the Cowboys . The game turned during a disastrous fourth-quarter sequence that featured three interceptions in six pass attempts by Hill, who was clearly affected by a finger injury suffered in the first half. New Orleans could still make noise with a win streak, but thatâs not happening unless they get healthy at key spots along the offensive line ( Terron Armstead , Ryan Ramczyk ) and at running back ( Alvin Kamara ). Hillâs finger issue is a concern, as well, though it's unclear if it'll require surgery in the near term or if he'll be able to play through it."
2021,14,27,Chicago Bears,4-8,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 27 It's hard to get very excited about watching the Bears right now, as the mostly quiet crowd at Soldier Field on Sunday afternoon will surely attest. Chicago is pretty much out of the NFC playoff picture , the embattled head coach seems like he's on a countdown clock to Jan. 10, and Justin Fields ' injured ribs have kept him out of the lineup for two weeks and counting. Backup quarterback Andy Dalton made some unwelcome personal history against the Cardinals, tying a career high with four interceptions that led to 23 Arizona points. That's six losses in seven games for the Mouses of the Midway."
2021,14,28,Atlanta Falcons,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 28 The financials connected to Matt Ryan make him the Falconsâ likely starter for the balance of this season and the next one, as well â¦ but you wonder if Arthur Smith is entirely comfortable with that idea. Itâs not fair to put Atlantaâs sleepy attack at the feet of the greatest quarterback the franchise has ever had, but a leaky offensive line combined with the 36-year-oldâs poor pocket mobility has made for ugly football when the Falcons face a team with any pass rush. Perhaps Atlanta fixes this fatal flaw with a smart offseason of fortifications along the line, but this increasingly feels like a marriage in which a clean break would serve both sides well. Easier said than done, of course."
2021,14,29,New York Jets,3-9,"Previous rank: No. 29 ï»¿ï»¿ Let's focus on a positive that came out of the latest lopsided Jets loss : Zach Wilson showed some legitimate promise with an excellent first half against the Eagles. The rookie quarterback, who has seemed overwhelmed for long stretches of his rookie season, led the Jets to touchdowns on each of their first three possessions -- breaking a season-long trend of slow starts to begin his NFL career. Wilson moved well on his injured knee and unfurled some precise lasers that sparked the imagination of excitement-starved Jets fans at the Meadowlands. New York's defense is an abomination that doesn't allow them to be competitive on most weeks, but a strong finish by Wilson will send the organization into the offseason on a high."
2021,14,30,Detroit Lions,1-10-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 Jared Goff read the coverage, found the receiver and delivered the completion . His celebration began, not with a sprint to celebrate with wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown , but with a beeline toward Dan Campbell , the head coach who wanted this win more than anyone. The Lions beat the Vikings in dramatic fashion on Sunday, eliminating the prospect of another winless season in Detroit and pumping some good spirit into a region reeling from senseless tragedy. After the game, Campbell dedicated the win to all the people impacted by the recent school shooting in Oxford, Michigan. This has not been an easy year for the Lions -- itâs been a pretty rough millennium, in fact -- but on Sunday, the team authored one of the most indelible moments of the NFL season."
2021,14,31,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-10,"Previous rank: No. 31 Urban Meyer surely believed heâd be immune from the struggles of so many other hotshot college coaches who sauntered into the NFL then promptly fell on their faces. Meyer went 83-9 during his fantastically successful seven-year run at Ohio State, but it took less than three months for Meyer to surpass that loss total in his debut season with the Jaguars. âI wish I had all the answers, and Iâd give them to you,â Meyer said after a blowout loss to the Rams dropped Jacksonville to 2-10. âI donât know the answers other than I know this: that youâre going to keep swinging and keep working together.â Is Meyer up for the challenge thatâs in front of him? Stay tuned."
2021,14,32,Houston Texans,2-10,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Texans were shut out for the second time this season, the latest indignity in a season full of them. Tyrod Taylor was sent to the bench during the blowout to Colts, and Ian Rapoport reported Monday the veteran is considered week-to-week with a wrist injury on his non-throwing arm. That opens the door for rookie Davis Mills to return to the lineup in Week 14 , and most likely, for the balance of the regular season. Something tells us that the Texansâ Week 1 starter at QB in 2022 isnât currently on the roster. In fact, weâd be willing to bet that a lot of players who will be starting for the Texans in Week 1 of 2022 arenât currently under contract with the team."
2021,15,1,Green Bay Packers,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 1 Bad news for the NFC: You had your chance to play the Packers when their offense was mortal. The last three weeks have seen the return of the unstoppable Green Bay attack that defined most of last season for the defending (and future) NFC North champions. As Aaron Rodgers keeps talking about his toe injury getting worse and worse, his play gets better and better. The reigning MVP delivered a masterful performance on Sunday night against the Bears and has thrown 10 touchdown passes against zero interceptions with a completion percentage just shy of 70 percent since Week 11. When you combine this version of the offense with a top-10 defense, it adds up to the best, most complete team in the NFL."
2021,15,2,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 Tom Brady owns the Bills. Always has, always will ... but things got dicey on Sunday. The Bucs built a 24-3 halftime lead before a second-half collapse that necessitated a red-zone stand just to get to overtime. After the Tampa Bay defense finally managed to stop a rampaging Josh Allen in overtime, Brady handled the rest. The 700th touchdown pass of his career was a perfectly placed spiral to a wide-open Breshad Perriman , who motored untouched into the end zone for the 58-yard game-winner. Brady is now 107-1 in games in which his team leads by 21 or more at any point, and the Bucs remain just a step behind the Packers in the race for the No. 1 seed in the NFC."
2021,15,3,Arizona Cardinals,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Cardinals' troubles at home surfaced again in a disappointing 30-23 loss to the Rams on Monday night. In a game where Los Angeles' best players stepped up to cover for the loss of Jalen Ramsey , several of Arizona's top stars weren't up for the challenge. Kyler Murray made physical and mental errors, DeAndre Hopkins had a crucial fourth-down drop and was largely neutralized in coverage, and no one on the Cardinals' defense stepped up to make a game-changing play as Matthew Stafford repeatedly took the Rams up and down the field. Just like that, Arizona drops from the No. 1 to the No. 3 seed in the NFC while the lead over L.A. shrinks to just one game in the division with four to play. Buckle up."
2021,15,4,Kansas City Chiefs,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 It's been a season of false starts for the offense, but maybe this will be the impetus for a great rise. The Chiefs reeled off 35 unanswered points in the first half against the Raiders en route to a 48-9 win , a necessary laugher with a huge divisional showdown on tap against the Chargers on Thursday Night Football . The offense played its most efficient game of the season, winning the battle up front and avoiding its two biggest issues: turnovers and drops. The final score is perhaps a bit misleading for a team that managed a comparatively pedestrian total of 372 yards of offense, but the Chiefs dictated the flow of the game and didn't self-sabotage at any moment. Progress."
2021,15,5,New England Patriots,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 Bill Belichick was roundly lionized for his decision to put Mac Jones on ice in Orchard Park and turn to his running game in extreme weather conditions, but the Pats took out the Bills before a Week 14 bye because the defense again delivered in the clutch. New England has the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (allowing just 15.4 points per game) and the No. 3 total defense (310.0 yards per game allowed). The numbers are even better during the team's seven-game winning streak: Opponents have averaged just over 10 points per game, with the Pats forcing at least one turnover in every one of those contests. Come January, Belichick might be in possession of the only defense in football that counts as a true difference-maker. This could prove to be advantageous."
2021,15,6,Los Angeles Rams,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 8 So much for the talk that Sean McVay's team was ""too soft"" to hold its own with the NFL elite. It got a little scary at the end, but the Rams were the better group in a 30-23 win over the Cardinals, a game that could swing not just the NFC West but the balance of power in the conference as the playoffs inch closer. Los Angeles' performance was especially impressive given the stunning news shortly before kickoff that Jalen Ramsey would miss the game after landing on the reserve/COVID-19 list . The Rams persevered because their other stars showed up: Matthew Stafford , Aaron Donald , Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. all made key contributions in the win. As a result, Los Angeles once again looks the part of a legit Super Bowl contender."
2021,15,7,Dallas Cowboys,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 The Cowboys' defense was a big-play machine in Sunday's win over the Washington Football Team. Defensive end Randy Gregory returned to the lineup and made two huge plays, an acrobatic interception that led to a Dallas touchdown and the strip-sack of Kyle Allen that sealed the win in the fourth quarter. Micah Parsons also continued to build on his outrageous rookie season with a sack-fumble that produced a touchdown. Dak Prescott and the Dallas attack remain locked in a curious funk, but the Cowboys all but sealed the NFC East by showing they are more than the star wattage on that side of the ball. No wonder Mike McCarthy felt so confident ."
2021,15,8,Indianapolis Colts,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 9 The Colts enjoyed the advantage of a late bye and now have everything in front of them, with back-to-back matchups against the Patriots and Cardinals . Those two teams have a combined record of 19-7, and Indianapolis has a chance to stamp itself as a legit Super Bowl contender in the most crucial two-week stretch of its season. Much has been made about the Colts' poor record against quality opponents, but their last three losses -- to the Ravens , Titans and Bucs -- were all games in which Indy led or was tied in the fourth quarter. If the Colts learn how to close out games, there is no ceiling on their season."
2021,15,9,Los Angeles Chargers,8-5,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Chargers welcomed a bad Giants team into their building on Sunday and took care of business -- a welcome development for a group that has struggled with consistency this season. Justin Herbert delivered another excellent performance, hooking up on a highlight-reel touchdown connection with Jalen Guyton for the second straight week while becoming the first QB in NFL history to reach 30 touchdown passes in each of his first two seasons. Now things get serious: The Chargers welcome the Chiefs to SoFi Stadium on Thursday night with a golden opportunity to make the AFC West very interesting. These Herbert-v.-Mahomes affairs should get prime-time billing every season."
2021,15,10,Buffalo Bills,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Bills are on a losing streak that's threatening their season, but Josh Allen reminded the world on Sunday this is not a squad bereft of hope. The quarterback put his team on his back in the second half against the Bucs, leading Buffalo to four scoring drives to wipe out a 24-3 halftime deficit and force overtime. The Bills faltered on both sides of the ball in OT, but the team's second-half surge against the defending champs showed the great potential that still lurks within. Allen became just the third player in NFL history to throw for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in the same game. In a frustrating season, he remains an X-factor in the AFC."
2021,15,11,San Francisco 49ers,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 14 George Kittle is a historically great tight end. To wit: Kittle piled up 13 catches for 151 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's wild overtime win over the Bengals, becoming the first tight end in NFL history to post 150-plus receiving yards and a touchdown in back-to-back games. Jimmy Garoppolo and Brandon Aiyuk connected on the dramatic touchdown pass that clinched the win and put San Francisco in playoff position with four games to play, but Kittle remains Kyle Shanahan's most vital asset. When Kittle's in the lineup, the Niners can beat anyone. Remove him from the mix, and they are ordinary."
2021,15,12,Tennessee Titans,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 13 The good news came in waves on Sunday: It started with a report that Derrick Henry (foot surgery) could return to the field as early as Week 18. Then there was Julio Jones , whose own return to the lineup surely produced a deep exhale of relief from beleaguered quarterback Ryan Tannehill . Finally, and most importantly, the Titans won a football game for the first time in nearly a month. The tape from a 20-0 shutout of the lowly Jaguars is unlikely to be shipped to Canton, but the victory was absolutely necessary as Mike Vrabel's team looks to navigate through its injury quagmire to lock up another AFC South title and make a push for the No. 1 seed."
2021,15,13,Cincinnati Bengals,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Bengals have graduated from league doormat to a fun team with potential. But the next step? The one where they become a consistent winner? That continues to elude Zac Taylor's group. Cincinnati roared back from a 14-point second-half deficit to force overtime, then grabbed a 3-point lead in the extra period, only to watch the defense falter in a painful 26-23 loss to the 49ers. After the game, Taylor was left to answer questions as to why he got conservative with his play-calling once Joe Burrow and the passing game stormed into field-goal range in OT. Ja'Marr Chase offered a telling answer when asked the same question: ""Shoot,"" he said. ""Good question, man. Good question."""
2021,15,14,Miami Dolphins,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 15 Jaylen Waddle 's tremendous rookie season has flown under the radar a bit. But let's give it some shine with the help of the NFL Research gang: The first-round pick needs 16 receptions over the last four games to break Anquan Boldin's all-time rookie catch record (101 in 2003). Bet you didn't know that! How about this: Waddle already has six games with eight catches or more this season, tied with Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014 for the most such games by a rookie since at least 1950. Boldin and Beckham is the superstar company you want to be in."
2021,15,15,Cleveland Browns,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 16 It got downright terrifying at the end, but the Browns' defense got the final stop it needed against the Ravens to avoid disaster and put Cleveland in good position to actually win the AFC North. That seems like a crazy thought, given all of Cleveland's struggles in this frustrating season, but things are setting up well in a division that doesn't have any true powerhouse. Still, problems persist: The Browns nearly blew a 21-point lead in large part because the offense remains stuck in mud with Baker Mayfield under center. Mayfield told reporters after the game his banged-up body was feeling better after the Week 13 bye, but Cleveland was still shut out in the second half and managed less than 300 yards of offense. If Baker doesn't play better, the Browns are cooked."
2021,15,16,Baltimore Ravens,8-5,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Tyler Huntley nearly led the Ravens to a miracle win over the Browns , but moral victories don't mean much in December. Baltimore's grip on the AFC North loosened with its second straight divisional loss, and Lamar Jackson 's health looms over everything. John Harbaugh told reporters on Monday that Jackson avoided the dreaded high ankle sprain in the loss to Cleveland, and he sounded hopeful Jackson would play in Week 15 . Jackson's presence is a necessity as the Ravens search to fix an offense that's been flailing for weeks, and it's fair to wonder if the quarterback will be able to attack defenses with his legs if his ankle is compromised. Baltimore will enter the crucible of the regular season in its most vulnerable state."
2021,15,17,Minnesota Vikings,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 19 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Why can't the Vikings just be normal? It's a simple question with a complicated, perhaps unknowable, answer. The Vikings jumped out to a 29-0 third-quarter lead at home against the Steelers on Thursday Night Football , and somehow still ended up playing another game that came down to the final snap. Credit the Vikings' defense for getting that last stop, but it's become obvious that Mike Zimmer's team is affected by the knowledge that it always lets opponents back into games. It's become the Vikings' DNA, a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it's aging the entire state of Minnesota in dog years. Said Zimmer : ""That team that played in the first half could probably beat anybody. That team that played in the second half could probably get beat by anybody."""
2021,15,18,Washington Football Team,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Taylor Heinicke has had his moments this season, but the Washington offense too often looks mediocre when the high-moxie QB doesn't have a run game to fall back on. With Antonio Gibson and the ground attack neutralized by the Cowboys' stout front, Heinicke failed to move the offense before departing in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. It didn't help that Terry McLaurin exited the game with a concussion, but it's become increasingly clear this offense needs a talent infusion to take the next step. Does that include an upgrade at quarterback? If his body allows it, Heinicke will get four more games to make his case."
2021,15,19,Philadelphia Eagles,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 20 Gardner Minshew 's excellent spot start against the Jets drew national attention, but the story of the Eagles' offensive renaissance continues to trace back to a stellar running attack. Philly has rushed for at least 180 yards in four straight games, the longest such streak by an Eagles team since 1950. It's also the longest streak the NFL has seen since the Lamar Jackson -led Ravens attack of 2018. Jackson's early-career arc is obviously something the Eagles are trying to emulate with Jalen Hurts , another fast and athletic quarterback whose passing abilities could use some refinement. The Eagles' smash-mouth attack should play well in a closing stretch entirely contained within the NFC East."
2021,15,20,Seattle Seahawks,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 Well, hello, Rashaad Penny . The former first-round pick became something of a forgotten man in Seattle as a series of injuries stunted his NFL trajectory, but all that will be forgotten if he keeps playing like he did on Sunday against the Texans. Penny sliced up the Houston defense for 137 yards and rushed for scores of 32 and 47 yards in a 33-13 win . He did this despite Alex Collins being back in the lineup, which should tell you Pete Carroll is feeling good about riding with Penny down the stretch, if the 25-year-old's body is up to the task. Look closely, and you can see the slightest glimmer of hope for the Seahawks in the NFC playoff race ."
2021,15,21,Pittsburgh Steelers,6-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 18 The Steelers are like a zombie that doesn't know it's dead yet. They take hits, they appear to no longer be amongst the living, and yet, they ... just ... keep ... coming. Ben Roethlisberger and a revitalized defense nearly dug Pittsburgh out of a 29-0 third-quarter hole against the Vikings , the potential game-tying score bouncing off the fingertips of Pat Freiermuth as time ran out. Mike Tomlin isn't a ""moral victory"" guy, but I'm sure there was a part of the coach that had admiration for an obviously flawed team that refused to quit. At 6-6-1, there remains a path to the postseason , but a rugged schedule makes it more likely Tomlin might be coaching the first sub-.500 team of his career."
2021,15,22,Denver Broncos,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ï»¿ The Broncos took the field on offense for the first time on Sunday with just 10 men, a nod of respect and recognition for Demaryius Thomas, the longtime Broncos wide receiver who died suddenly last week at the age of 33. It was a classy move by the team, which then went out and put together one of its most complete efforts of the season in a 38-10 win over the Lions. Denver had something cooking in its backfield at Mile High: Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon combined for nearly 200 total yards and four touchdowns in the win. It's the type of attack that Vic Fangio would love to replicate on a weekly basis. Not every opponent will be as gracious as the Lions, of course."
2021,15,23,New Orleans Saints,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ Few players are as important to their team as Alvin Kamara is to the Saints. The Pro Bowl running back returned from a four-game absence and whipped up on the Jets, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdown in a 30-9 win . Kamara counts as the only real firepower on an offense that lacks proven playmakers and is counting on Taysom Hill , a quarterback who wasn't a natural thrower of the football before he jacked up his finger . Hill didn't look great against the Jets, and it was a surprise to see how long it took for his rushing ability to be integrated into the attack on Sunday. The Saints need Hill in that dual-threat mode to survive."
2021,15,24,Atlanta Falcons,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ï»¿ The Falcons are, almost impossibly, very much alive in the NFC playoff race. Atlanta forced three Carolina turnovers -- including a critical Mykal Walker pick-six of Cam Newton -- en route to a 29-21 win in Charlotte . The Falcons' 5-2 road record would ordinarily function as a golden ticket to the playoffs, but a 1-5 mark at Mercedes-Benz Stadium has held Arthur Smith's team down. Atlanta won on Sunday because it combined those takeaways with a strong running game -- the team went over 100 yards rushing for the third straight week, with Mike Davis finally looking like a functional complement to Cordarrelle Patterson ."
2021,15,25,Las Vegas Raiders,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ It took exactly one play from scrimmage -- a Josh Jacobs fumble returned for a Chiefs touchdown -- to know how Sunday was going to turn out. The Raiders showed up in only the most literal of ways at Arrowhead, falling behind 35-0 in the first half en route to a 48-9 loss that stands as the worst defeat in the history of their 62-year rivalry with Kansas City. Las Vegas has gone 1-5 since returning from the Week 8 bye, and yet another December collapse could lead to sweeping organizational changes. That reality should be enough to summon necessary urgency, but on Sunday, the Raiders looked very much like a team that just wants to go home. Where have we seen that before?"
2021,15,26,Chicago Bears,4-9,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 27 The internet had its fun on Sunday night with Matt Nagy, whose comment to an NBC sideline reporter at halftime -- âIâm having so much funâ -- set the table for thousands of windmill Twitter dunks upon the beleaguered head coach as the Packers ran away with another win in the second half. Itâs an in-game quote you only get from a guy who knows heâs a goner: He reached the position of head coach of the Chicago Bears, and, on this night, his team was going punch-for-punch with a mighty division rival. Nagy was trying to enjoy this moment in the big chair because he seems to know it wonât be his for too much longer. As former Colts coach Chuck Pagano once said: âThey can fire you, but they canât eat you.â Nagy has reached the stage of acceptance."
2021,15,27,New York Giants,4-9,"Previous rank: No. 24 Itâs hard to find something the Giants do well. The offense wasnât very good with Daniel Jones at quarterback â itâs worse with career journeyman Mike Glennon at the controls. Then thereâs the defense, the team strength of a year ago but very much an average unit in 2021. Justin Herbert and the Chargers rolled up 289 yards, 18 first downs and 24 points in the first half alone on Sunday at SoFi Stadium . How much of this mess should be put at the feet of Joe Judge? The second-year coach isnât getting results, but he hasnât exactly been set up for success, either."
2021,15,28,Carolina Panthers,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 25 Cam Newton lawn darts or P.J. Walker hospital balls? This is the choice facing Matt Rhule, whose self-made QB quandary has swallowed up this Carolina season. The Panthers all but excused themselves from the NFC playoff picture with Sunday's dispiriting home loss to the Falcons that featured three QB turnovers and extensive playing time for both of Rhuleâs underwhelming options under center. On Monday, Rhule told reporters that it's a "" possibility "" Sam Darnold is back in the mix once he recovers from his shoulder injury. Decisions, decisions, decisions."
2021,15,29,New York Jets,3-10,"Previous rank: No. 29 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ More of the same. The Jets suffered their seventh double-digit defeat of the season Sunday, this time a 30-7 clunker against a middling Saints team that isnât exactly summoning memories of the Drew Brees glory years. The Jets have so many issues, but a lack of talent stands out most. They donât have any game-changers on defense, and the offense is punchless without Elijah Moore (leg), Corey Davis (core surgery) and Michael Carter (ankle). It creates a very difficult situation for Zach Wilson , who like Sam Darnold before him, becomes difficult to evaluate because of an absence of structure. Around and around the wheel goes for this organization, now 11 years deep into a playoff drought that shows no sign of letting up."
2021,15,30,Detroit Lions,1-11-1,"Previous rank: No. 30 The afterglow of the Lionsâ first win of the season faded as the reality of another losing Sunday set in. Detroit surrendered 184 yards on the ground to the Broncos, while the offense struggled to create big plays with DâAndre Swift and T.J. Hockenson sidelined by injuries in a 38-10 loss . Jared Goff didnât complete a pass over 20 yards the entire game. Lions coach Dan Campbell said Monday he is "" hopeful "" that Swift will return to action in Week 15 against the Cardinals . If not, the immortal Craig Reynolds will continue to see extensive work."
2021,15,31,Houston Texans,2-11,"Previous rank: No. 32 Iâve had a working theory that the Texans' plan is to memory hole the entire 2021 season once this whole sordid affair wraps up on Jan. 9. That hypothetical plan hit a minor snag on Sunday, when Ka'imi Fairbairn split the uprights with a 61-yard field goal on the final play of the first half against the Seahawks -- the longest field goal in the 20-year history of the Texans. Houston brass can completely reboot the machine if they wish this offseason, but the next Texans media guide will be unable to ignore the ineradicable greatness Fairbairn gave the world on Dec. 12, 2021."
2021,15,32,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-11,"Previous rank: No. 31 I donât know if thereâs a case quite like Urban Meyerâs in NFL history. A college coach with a legendary rÃ©sumÃ© makes the jump to the pros on a massive contract and immediately floods the entire organization with a tsunami of toxicity . Sure, weâve seen esteemed college coaches flop in the league plenty of times before, but Meyerâs case is shaping up as the masterpiece of this particular genre -- the Mona Lisa of malfeasance. With Trevor Lawrence struggling and serious unrest behind the scenes, Jaguars owner Shad Khan is facing a painful decision that would've seemed inconceivable to him less than 12 months ago ."
2021,16,1,Green Bay Packers,11-3,"Previous rank: No. 1 Green Bay's defense has been at a consistent top-10 level for the majority of the season, so we'll give it a mulligan for a fourth-quarter letdown Sunday that nearly allowed Tyler Huntley and the Ravens to escape with a dramatic comeback win. The Packers got the stop they needed on Huntley's two-point conversion attempt, and as a result, they are NFC North champions for the third straight year. Aaron Rodgers , meanwhile, is now in the driver's seat for his fourth MVP award (and second in as many years). Rodgers posted three more TD passes and has been the league's best quarterback for the past month. Crunch-time performance counts in this race ... or at least it should ."
2021,16,2,Kansas City Chiefs,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 Travis Kelce * has rarely performed like a dominant force this season, so consider the veteran's sudden re-emergence as a game-wrecker an early Christmas present for the Chiefs and their fans. Kelce lit up the Chargers for a career-high 191 yards and two touchdowns on 10 catches, including the game-winning 34-yard gallop to the end zone in overtime on Thursday night . The dramatic victory moved Kansas City one step closer to its sixth consecutive AFC West title and offered more evidence the mostly dormant offense woke up just in time. Said Patrick Mahomes of his trusty tight end: ""You think he's old. He can't run by people. But he's still running by people. And he got in the end zone."" * -- Kelce was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Monday."
2021,16,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 2 Sometimes the Football Gods throw us a curveball just to keep us off the scent. The defending champion Bucs limped to a 9-0 loss to the Saints on Sunday Night Football, putting the team's hopes for a playoff bye in serious doubt. Mike Evans (hamstring), Chris Godwin (knee) and Leonard Fournette (hamstring) all exited with injuries, leaving Tom Brady in a vulnerable and frustrating situation. Brady struggled without his key playmakers, committing two turnovers in his first shutout loss in over 15 years. Bad news got worse on Monday when further tests revealed a torn ACL for Godwin . The impending return of Antonio Brown has become a necessity for an offense suddenly searching for answers."
2021,16,4,Los Angeles Rams,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 Survive and advance. The Rams worked their way through the COVID-19 week from hell, then found a way in a 20-10 win over the Seahawks on Tuesday at SoFi Stadium. The offensive star, once again, was Cooper Kupp , who caught nine passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, setting a Rams single-season record with 122 receptions on the season. The Offensive Player of the Year Award should come down to Kupp and Jonathan Taylor -- no other candidates should bother to apply. Credit also must go to the defense, which held Russell Wilson to 156 yards in a must-win game for Seattle. The Rams now find themselves tied with the Cardinals atop the NFC West with three games to play. This should be fun."
2021,16,5,Arizona Cardinals,10-4,Previous rank: No. 3 The Cardinals have now lost four of seven after their 7-0 start. Sunday brought the season's most disappointing moment: a 30-12 defeat to the Lions in which the Cardinals were never particularly competitive. Did Arizona look past an inferior opponent? Has the offense become limited with DeAndre Hopkins out of the picture? Did the Cardinals -- gulp -- peak at the wrong time? All fair questions for a team that went from NFC leader to slumping superpower in danger of losing its grip on the NFC West. A home showdown with the surging Colts should tell us a lot about Kliff Kingsbury's team.
2021,16,6,Indianapolis Colts,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 8 Once again, it was Jonathan Taylor to the rescue. The MVP candidate busted through a box packed with defenders on the 67-yard touchdown that put the kibosh on a New England rally and clinched a massive 27-17 win on Saturday night. Frank Reich remained committed to the run down the stretch, showing a noticeable lack of faith in Carson Wentz after the quarterback threw an ugly interception earlier in the fourth quarter. Wentz's ability to come through when it matters most remains uncertain at best, but in Taylor, the Colts have a special talent who can put the team on his back. The Colts have proven their bona fides as legit AFC contenders."
2021,16,7,New England Patriots,9-5,"Previous rank: No. 5 The seven-game winning streak is a memory after multiple uncharacteristic mistakes and breakdowns in fundamentals led to a 27-17 loss to the Colts on Saturday night. The defense failed to capitalize on turnover opportunities, the punt unit gave up a block and a touchdown and Mac Jones threw two interceptions, including one in the red zone . It was ugly, but there's something to say about the fourth-quarter reboot that produced 17 points and put a serious scare into the home team. Jones made several money throws in the final 15 minutes, and the defense took over the game ... until Jonathan Taylor bailed out Indy with a breakaway TD to clinch it. The AFC East lead will be up for grabs on Sunday against the Bills ."
2021,16,8,Dallas Cowboys,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Cowboys have become the NFC version of what the Chiefs were in the AFC for much of this season: a team filled with high-profile stars on offense getting regularly carried by its defense. Dak Prescott and the Dallas attack continued to look pedestrian in a 21-6 win over the Giants, leaving it to the defense to do the heavy lifting. Dan Quinn's guys happily accepted the challenge, forcing four turnovers for the third consecutive week. The stats tell the story of an opportunistic unit: The Cowboys lead the league with 23 interceptions and are tied for first in takeaways with 31. The D will take Big D to an NFC East title, but there's no road back to the Lombardi unless the offense finds its groove."
2021,16,9,Buffalo Bills,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Bills took care of business on Sunday in Orchard Park, beating up on a depleted Panthers team in a 31-14 win that snapped a two-game losing streak. Josh Allen showed no ill effects from the sprained foot suffered in Week 14's loss to the Bucs , and Gabriel Davis continued his upward climb with two touchdowns and 85 yards receiving. The victory, combined with a Patriots loss in Indy , puts destiny in Buffalo's hands. Beat the Pats on Sunday in Foxborough and take care of business against the Falcons and Jets, and this frustrating regular season will end with the desired result : a division title and home playoff contest next month. Will these Bills rise to the occasion?"
2021,16,10,Los Angeles Chargers,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 9 Is there such a thing as believing in your guys â¦ too much? Over and over, the Chargers passed on easy points on Thursday night in favor of bold risks that didnât pay off. Two trips inside the Kansas City 5-yard line ended with fourth-down incompletions; another trip imploded with a goal-line fumble . More conservative decision-making by Brandon Staley likely would have avoided the fate of Thursday nightâs painful overtime loss to the Chiefs -- but Staley has a vision. ""Thatâs the way we're going to play around here,â the coach said after the game . â... With a quarterback like ours, with an offense like ours, thatâs how weâre going to play."""
2021,16,11,San Francisco 49ers,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Niners took care of business against the Falcons on Sunday and will enter a Thursday night showdown with the slumping Titans having won five of six games. There are encouraging signs all across the roster, but donât sleep on the second-half surge of Jimmy Garoppolo . The veteran quarterback -- a figure of suspicion in recent years -- has posted the fourth-best QBR in the NFL since Week 8. Heâs cut down on mistakes, found a rhythm with George Kittle and Brandon Aiyuk and has stayed healthy -- all key factors in San Francisco finding its footing. Trey Lance remains the future, but Garoppolo is taking advantage of his moment in time, however fleeting it may be."
2021,16,12,Cincinnati Bengals,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 13 Predicting where this winding Bengals season goes is a foolâs errand, but itâs at least possible Joe Burrow âs 56-yard touchdown strike to Tyler Boyd on Sunday is remembered as a turning point. Cincinnatiâs offense was in a deep slumber before that third-quarter strike, and it allowed the Bengals to escape with a 15-10 win over the Broncos that kept their playoff hopes from slipping into dream territory. Of course, one big play doesnât cover up for the sins of an attack that was mostly limp against Denverâs quality defense. A Week 16 matchup against the Ravens should tell us a lot about both teams. Itâs clarity that we seek in the AFC North."
2021,16,13,Miami Dolphins,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 14 On Sunday, the Dolphins became just the second team in NFL history to get to 7-7 after starting a season 1-7. So why are we still struggling to take this team seriously in the muddled AFC ? Much of that goes back to a ridiculously favorable schedule: Miami's last five opponents (covering six games) have a combined record of 26-58. A prime-time win over the Ravens stands out, but the streak also includes victories over the Texans, Panthers, Giants and Jets (twice!). We'll learn a lot more about the Dolphins over their final three weeks as the schedule tightens up considerably . Sunday's matchup against the Saints will function as close to a playoff game for both teams."
2021,16,14,Tennessee Titans,9-5,"Previous rank: No. 12 The idea here is that the cavalry will eventually arrive for the Titans in the form of a healthy A.J. Brown and Derrick Henry . (Weâve given up on the idea of Julio Jones as a difference-maker and you should, too.) But will Brown -- and eventually Henry -- really serve as the magic elixir that fixes Tennessee? On Sunday in Pittsburgh, the Titans' offense managed just one touchdown and turned the ball over three times in the span of 10 calamitous plays in a 19-13 loss . Tennessee has actually run the ball well during Henryâs absence, but pass-protection failures and Ryan Tannehill âs inability to make plays downfield are glaring issues. Does that make Brown the skeleton key? Does a key to unlock this attack actually exist?"
2021,16,15,Minnesota Vikings,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 17 Kirk Cousins should have feasted on Monday night. The quarterback was facing a Bears team that was missing many of its defensive starters due to injuries and COVID-19 protocols, including its entire defensive backfield. But Cousins struggled mightily to move the ball against Chicago, finishing with two touchdown passes and a career-low 87 yards in the lackluster 17-9 win . Thatâs consecutive subpar performances by Cousins, who simply needs to play better to get the Vikings to the playoffs and alter the perception that heâs a stat compiler more than an actual winner under center. Yep, thatâs right ... this Sunday against the Rams : Itâs (yet another) Kirk Cousins Legacy Game!"
2021,16,16,Baltimore Ravens,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The analytics culture war that has consumed the Football Cognoscenti reached an apex on Sunday afternoon, when John Harbaugh lost his second game in three weeks on a final minute two-point conversion attempt that went sideways . Harbaugh was championed in some corners of the internet for his boldness, while others derided the coach for his stubborn refusal to take a more conservative, traditional path. No matter where you come down, it doesnât change the fact that the Ravens have gone from the No. 1 seed in the AFC to out of playoff positioning entirely in the span of a month. Lamar Jackson needs to get back on the field and deliver a statement of intent on Sunday against the Bengals ."
2021,16,17,Cleveland Browns,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 15 The insidious nature of the COVID-19 virus put the Browns in a nearly impossible situation in Week 15. Cleveland was without multiple starters and key personnel against the Raiders, including its top two quarterbacks and head coach Kevin Stefanski. But the backup Brownies stepped up. Nick Mullens performed well as the emergency QB, and the defense thrived ... until Derek Carr drove the Raiders to the winning field goal on the final play of the game. At 7-7 with a difficult schedule ahead, the Browns now face an uphill climb to a postseason return. ""This one hurts,"" Mullens said. ""I really believed in the fourth quarter that this night was destined for Cleveland. Sometimes, it doesn't work out like that."""
2021,16,18,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 21 ""I think we still have a pulse in this thing.â Ben Roethlisberger âs postgame comments seemed to bolster our theory that the Steelers are a zombie that doesnât know itâs dead yet. Mike Tomlinâs team continues to lumber mindlessly through the NFL landscape. These Steelers crash through barricaded doors, feast on the occasional arm, tumble down the unexpected hillside -- only to get back up in their eternal quest for ... not brains, but an unlikely playoff bid. Pittsburgh beat Tennessee thanks to a defense that forced three turnovers in the span of 10 plays and a kicker who converted four of his five field-goal attempts in a 19-13 win . Thereâs nothing pretty about the undead, but they demand to be taken seriously."
2021,16,19,Philadelphia Eagles,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 19 Jalen Hurts returned to the lineup and took care of business on Tuesday night, running for two scores and throwing for another in a 27-17 win that keeps the Eagles relevant in the NFC playoff picture . Philadelphia was able to take advantage of a Washington team missing five starters -- including quarterback Taylor Heinicke -- due to COVID-19. Phillyâs run game is no joke: The Eagles are the first team with 175-plus yards on the ground in seven straight games since the 1985 Chicago Bears. Philly doesnât have that legendary teamâs defense -- but it plays a style of ball that translates well to December and January. The schedule stays extremely soft this week with a home matchup against the broken Giants."
2021,16,20,New Orleans Saints,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ An upset win over Buccaneers -- even a bruised and battered Bucs team -- is worthy of significant praise, but can the Saints be taken seriously in the NFC given the limitations of their offense? Taysom Hill was a non-factor as both passer and runner of the football against Tampa Bay, and his high-stakes audition has been spotty, at best. New Orleans managed just 11 first downs on Sunday night on a paltry 3.5 yards per play. The three field goals produced by that output stood up because Cam Jordan and the New Orleans defense rattled Tom Brady before and after Mike Evans , Chris Godwin and Leonard Fournette all exited with injuries. Still, the Saints need to find more balance to play beyond the regular season."
2021,16,21,Las Vegas Raiders,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Style points aren't a thing. The Raiders needed to beat the COVID-19-compromised Browns to keep their playoff hopes alive -- and they achieved their goal with a 16-14 win in front of the Dawg Pound. Derek Carr led the Raiders down the field in the final seconds, and Daniel Carlson was once again money, drilling the 48-yard game-winning field goal as time expired. Carrâs latest crunch-time heroics came after the veteran QB appeared to lose the game by throwing an interception on Vegasâ penultimate possession. ""After that interception, I told the guys, âPlease, I promise weâll win it -- just get the ball back.' â The defense delivered the stop, and Carr kept his word . Another must-win game, this time against the Broncos, is up next ."
2021,16,22,Washington Football Team,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 18 The Football Team showed plenty of fight hanging tough against the Eagles on Tuesday night , but this is not a roster that can withstand many injuries -- or a full-blown COVID-19 outbreak . Washington jumped out to a 10-0 lead, but was outgained in yardage 519-237 and never found its footing with its top two quarterbacks taken out of action due to COVID-19 protocols. Washington needs to win out to have a chance at a playoff return, a nearly impossible ask for a team this compromised. âWeâre in a unique situation,"" wide receiver Terry McLaurin said. ""... We had the mindset going into the week that weâll play with whoever we have. This is the NFL, you have to be ready at all moments.â"
2021,16,23,Denver Broncos,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Broncos have told us who they are at this point: This is a team with a quality defense led by a coach in Vic Fangio who knows how to scramble up an opponentâs playbook. Unfortunately for the Broncos, teams are too often successful in scrambling Denverâs own attack, thus neutralizing the teamâs principle strength. Teddy Bridgewater exited Sundayâs damaging loss to the Bengals with a scary head injury that required a precautionary overnight hospital stay and puts his Week 16 availability in doubt. Meanwhile, the idea of Drew Lock stepping in to wake this dormant offense from its long winterâs nap feels like the plot of a particularly fanciful Lifetime Christmas movie."
2021,16,24,Seattle Seahawks,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 20 The Seahawks have felt out of sync all year. We saw it again in a 20-10 loss to the Rams on Tuesday that all but ended their season. The turning point came with eight minutes to play in the fourth quarter: D.K. Metcalf got behind Jalen Ramsey and was open for a potential game-tying touchdown strike. All Metcalf needed was an accurate rainbow deep ball from Wilson, the type of pass the quarterback has perfected over the past decade. But Wilsonâs pass hung up in the Los Angeles air, allowing Ramsey to get back in the play and force an incompletion. Wilson has been a special quarterback in his career, but his misfire in a critical juncture of the season was emblematic of the offenseâs year as a whole."
2021,16,25,Atlanta Falcons,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 24 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Falcons have hung around in the NFC playoff picture thanks to an unusual level of parity across the league this season combined with a series of narrow wins against mostly mediocre competition. But Atlanta has been exposed whenever it faces a team that profiles as an actual Super Bowl contender. The 49ers are just such a team, and they delivered a 31-13 thumping of Atlanta in an expected outcome. The Falcons can keep themselves in the postseason conversation with a win over the Lions on Sunday -- but itâs not crazy to say Detroit might be the superior team despite a worse record. The Falcons need serious work this offseason."
2021,16,26,Chicago Bears,4-10,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 26 The Bears deserve credit for fighting hard in Monday nightâs 17-9 loss to the Vikings. Chicago was missing a host of starters because of injuries and COVID-19 designations, but it battled to the end thanks to a stout defense that made life extremely difficult for Kirk Cousins (a career-worst 87 passing yards). If only Matt Nagy -- manic throughout the affair -- could unlock his own offense. Justin Fields and the Chicago attack couldnât find the end zone until a meaningless score as time expired, while five personal fouls (one committed by Nagy himself) furthered the narrative that this is a lost team wandering through the woods. Well, they are Bears."
2021,16,27,Detroit Lions,2-11-1,"Previous rank: No. 30 Dan Campbell has had his Lions fighting hard all season. On Sunday, they combined that consistent effort with great execution, resulting in a stunning blowout of the Cardinals. Jared Goff * continued his mastery against Kliff Kingsbury teams with three touchdown passes, while Detroit has found something in rookie receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown , who had eight catches for 90 yards with a score and now holds the single-season team record for catches by a rookie with 65. Detroit would be better off without a hot finish to its season from a draft-position perspective, but that goes against everything Campbell preaches inside the building. These Lions have heart -- and theyâre a dangerous opponent for any overconfident contender. * -- Goff was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Monday."
2021,16,28,Carolina Panthers,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ This has turned into a Murphyâs Law season for the Panthers: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. On Sunday in Buffalo, it was kicker Zane Gonzalez limping off the field after suffering a leg injury during pregame warmups. Carolina didnât need any extra challenges against a quality Buffalo opponent, and the resulting 31-14 loss could hardly be considered a surprise. Panthers fans who were thrilled to take their No. 1 jerseys out of storage should savor these last three games: Cam Newton âs time with the Panthers is certain to conclude after Week 18. What other changes are in store in Charlotte?"
2021,16,29,Houston Texans,3-11,"Previous rank: No. 31 When is a win actually a loss? Ask members of the Texans front office, who would probably admit over drinks at the holiday party that Sundayâs 30-16 victory over the Jaguars counted as a substantial setback for the organization. Houston swept the season series from Jacksonville, an act of bad-team-on-bad-team crime that pretty much ensures the Texans wonât have the No. 1 overall pick come April. Meanwhile, theyâre going to produce a 30 for 30 doc one day about Brandin Cooks â 1,000-yard season for the 2021 Houston Texans. What if I told you â¦"
2021,16,30,New York Giants,4-10,"Previous rank: No. 27 Daniel Jones â third NFL season is officially over after the Giants moved their quarterback to injured reserve with a neck injury. In some ways, Jonesâ latest season was a lot like the two before it: He flashed legit ability as a passer and runner, but the New York offense never consistently performed as the Giants remained an NFC also-ran. The job of Big Blue management is to discern how much of the teamâs struggles connect to Jones, and how much goes back to failures in coaching and talent acquisition around the former top-10 pick. Jonesâ future ultimately depends on who is running the show at the Meadowlands in a couple of months. Stay tuned."
2021,16,31,New York Jets,3-11,"Previous rank: No. 29 The Jets are deficient in so many areas that it seems reductive to put their ineptitude at the feet of a 22-year-old rookie quarterback. Still, Zach Wilson âs ongoing struggles cannot be ignored. New York managed three first downs in the second half of Sundayâs 31-24 loss to the Dolphins and the big-picture numbers paint a grim picture:  When Wilson missed four weeks with a knee injury, the offense, led by a coterie of backup QBs, averaged 24.5 points and 435.8 yards per game. In the four weeks since the No. 2 pickâs return to the lineup, the Jets have averaged 16.3 points and 257.8 yards per game. Wilson has yet to put together a full four quarters of quality play this season -- and heâs running out of time to do so."
2021,16,32,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-12,"Previous rank: No. 32 See? It wasnât Urban Meyerâs fault, after all. We kid â¦ but Sundayâs 30-16 loss to the Texans served as a reminder that Meyerâs general incompetence combined with Jacksonvilleâs young and talent-deficient roster made for one of the gnarliest failure stews in recent memory. The only real goals left this season: 1) Escape the final three weeks without any serious injury to Trevor Lawrence ; and 2) lock down the No. 1 overall pick for the second consecutive year. Facing the similarly downtrodden Jets puts an uncertain competitive glow upon Week 16 ."
2021,17,1,Green Bay Packers,11-3,"Previous rank: No. 1 Green Bay's defense has been at a consistent top-10 level for the majority of the season, so we'll give it a mulligan for a fourth-quarter letdown Sunday that nearly allowed Tyler Huntley and the Ravens to escape with a dramatic comeback win. The Packers got the stop they needed on Huntley's two-point conversion attempt, and as a result, they are NFC North champions for the third straight year. Aaron Rodgers , meanwhile, is now in the driver's seat for his fourth MVP award (and second in as many years). Rodgers posted three more TD passes and has been the league's best quarterback for the past month. Crunch-time performance counts in this race ... or at least it should ."
2021,17,2,Kansas City Chiefs,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 Travis Kelce * has rarely performed like a dominant force this season, so consider the veteran's sudden re-emergence as a game-wrecker an early Christmas present for the Chiefs and their fans. Kelce lit up the Chargers for a career-high 191 yards and two touchdowns on 10 catches, including the game-winning 34-yard gallop to the end zone in overtime on Thursday night . The dramatic victory moved Kansas City one step closer to its sixth consecutive AFC West title and offered more evidence the mostly dormant offense woke up just in time. Said Patrick Mahomes of his trusty tight end: ""You think he's old. He can't run by people. But he's still running by people. And he got in the end zone."" * -- Kelce was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Monday."
2021,17,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 2 Sometimes the Football Gods throw us a curveball just to keep us off the scent. The defending champion Bucs limped to a 9-0 loss to the Saints on Sunday Night Football, putting the team's hopes for a playoff bye in serious doubt. Mike Evans (hamstring), Chris Godwin (knee) and Leonard Fournette (hamstring) all exited with injuries, leaving Tom Brady in a vulnerable and frustrating situation. Brady struggled without his key playmakers, committing two turnovers in his first shutout loss in over 15 years. Bad news got worse on Monday when further tests revealed a torn ACL for Godwin . The impending return of Antonio Brown has become a necessity for an offense suddenly searching for answers."
2021,17,4,Los Angeles Rams,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 Survive and advance. The Rams worked their way through the COVID-19 week from hell, then found a way in a 20-10 win over the Seahawks on Tuesday at SoFi Stadium. The offensive star, once again, was Cooper Kupp , who caught nine passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, setting a Rams single-season record with 122 receptions on the season. The Offensive Player of the Year Award should come down to Kupp and Jonathan Taylor -- no other candidates should bother to apply. Credit also must go to the defense, which held Russell Wilson to 156 yards in a must-win game for Seattle. The Rams now find themselves tied with the Cardinals atop the NFC West with three games to play. This should be fun."
2021,17,5,Arizona Cardinals,10-4,Previous rank: No. 3 The Cardinals have now lost four of seven after their 7-0 start. Sunday brought the season's most disappointing moment: a 30-12 defeat to the Lions in which the Cardinals were never particularly competitive. Did Arizona look past an inferior opponent? Has the offense become limited with DeAndre Hopkins out of the picture? Did the Cardinals -- gulp -- peak at the wrong time? All fair questions for a team that went from NFC leader to slumping superpower in danger of losing its grip on the NFC West. A home showdown with the surging Colts should tell us a lot about Kliff Kingsbury's team.
2021,17,6,Indianapolis Colts,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 8 Once again, it was Jonathan Taylor to the rescue. The MVP candidate busted through a box packed with defenders on the 67-yard touchdown that put the kibosh on a New England rally and clinched a massive 27-17 win on Saturday night. Frank Reich remained committed to the run down the stretch, showing a noticeable lack of faith in Carson Wentz after the quarterback threw an ugly interception earlier in the fourth quarter. Wentz's ability to come through when it matters most remains uncertain at best, but in Taylor, the Colts have a special talent who can put the team on his back. The Colts have proven their bona fides as legit AFC contenders."
2021,17,7,New England Patriots,9-5,"Previous rank: No. 5 The seven-game winning streak is a memory after multiple uncharacteristic mistakes and breakdowns in fundamentals led to a 27-17 loss to the Colts on Saturday night. The defense failed to capitalize on turnover opportunities, the punt unit gave up a block and a touchdown and Mac Jones threw two interceptions, including one in the red zone . It was ugly, but there's something to say about the fourth-quarter reboot that produced 17 points and put a serious scare into the home team. Jones made several money throws in the final 15 minutes, and the defense took over the game ... until Jonathan Taylor bailed out Indy with a breakaway TD to clinch it. The AFC East lead will be up for grabs on Sunday against the Bills ."
2021,17,8,Dallas Cowboys,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Cowboys have become the NFC version of what the Chiefs were in the AFC for much of this season: a team filled with high-profile stars on offense getting regularly carried by its defense. Dak Prescott and the Dallas attack continued to look pedestrian in a 21-6 win over the Giants, leaving it to the defense to do the heavy lifting. Dan Quinn's guys happily accepted the challenge, forcing four turnovers for the third consecutive week. The stats tell the story of an opportunistic unit: The Cowboys lead the league with 23 interceptions and are tied for first in takeaways with 31. The D will take Big D to an NFC East title, but there's no road back to the Lombardi unless the offense finds its groove."
2021,17,9,Buffalo Bills,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Bills took care of business on Sunday in Orchard Park, beating up on a depleted Panthers team in a 31-14 win that snapped a two-game losing streak. Josh Allen showed no ill effects from the sprained foot suffered in Week 14's loss to the Bucs , and Gabriel Davis continued his upward climb with two touchdowns and 85 yards receiving. The victory, combined with a Patriots loss in Indy , puts destiny in Buffalo's hands. Beat the Pats on Sunday in Foxborough and take care of business against the Falcons and Jets, and this frustrating regular season will end with the desired result : a division title and home playoff contest next month. Will these Bills rise to the occasion?"

There are encouraging signs all across the roster, but donât sleep on the second-half surge of Jimmy Garoppolo . The veteran quarterback -- a figure of suspicion in recent years -- has posted the fourth-best QBR in the NFL since Week 8. Heâs cut down on mistakes, found a rhythm with George Kittle and Brandon Aiyuk and has stayed healthy -- all key factors in San Francisco finding its footing.

Cincinnatiâs offense was in a deep slumber before that third-quarter strike, and it allowed the Bengals to escape with a 15-10 win over the Broncos that kept their playoff hopes from slipping into dream territory. Of course, one big play doesnât cover up for the sins of an attack that was mostly limp against Denverâs quality defense. A Week 16 matchup against the Ravens should tell us a lot about both teams. Itâs clarity that we seek in the AFC North."

On Sunday in Pittsburgh, the Titans' offense managed just one touchdown and turned the ball over three times in the span of 10 calamitous plays in a 19-13 loss . Tennessee has actually run the ball well during Henryâs absence, but pass-protection failures and Ryan Tannehill âs inability to make plays downfield are glaring issues.

Harbaugh was championed in some corners of the internet for his boldness, while others derided the coach for his stubborn refusal to take a more conservative, traditional path. No matter where you come down, it doesnât change the fact that the Ravens have gone from the No. 1 seed in the AFC to out of playoff positioning entirely in the span of a month. Lamar Jackson needs to get back on the field and deliver a statement of intent on Sunday against the Bengals ."
2021,17,17,Cleveland Browns,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 15 The insidious nature of the COVID-19 virus put the Browns in a nearly impossible situation in Week 15. Cleveland was without multiple starters and key personnel against the Raiders, including its top two quarterbacks and head coach Kevin Stefanski. But the backup Brownies stepped up. Nick Mullens performed well as the emergency QB, and the defense thrived ... until Derek Carr drove the Raiders to the winning field goal on the final play of the game. At 7-7 with a difficult schedule ahead, the Browns now face an uphill climb to a postseason return. ""This one hurts,"" Mullens said. ""I really believed in the fourth quarter that this night was destined for Cleveland. Sometimes, it doesn't work out like that."""
2021,17,18,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 21 ""I think we still have a pulse in this thing.â Ben Roethlisberger âs postgame comments seemed to bolster our theory that the Steelers are a zombie that doesnât know itâs dead yet. Mike Tomlinâs team continues to lumber mindlessly through the NFL landscape. These Steelers crash through barricaded doors, feast on the occasional arm, tumble down the unexpected hillside -- only to get back up in their eternal quest for ... not brains, but an unlikely playoff bid. Pittsburgh beat Tennessee thanks to a defense that forced three turnovers in the span of 10 plays and a kicker who converted four of his five field-goal attempts in a 19-13 win . Thereâs nothing pretty about the undead, but they demand to be taken seriously."
2021,17,19,Philadelphia Eagles,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 19 Jalen Hurts returned to the lineup and took care of business on Tuesday night, running for two scores and throwing for another in a 27-17 win that keeps the Eagles relevant in the NFC playoff picture . Philadelphia was able to take advantage of a Washington team missing five starters -- including quarterback Taylor Heinicke -- due to COVID-19. Phillyâs run game is no joke: The Eagles are the first team with 175-plus yards on the ground in seven straight games since the 1985 Chicago Bears. Philly doesnât have that legendary teamâs defense -- but it plays a style of ball that translates well to December and January. The schedule stays extremely soft this week with a home matchup against the broken Giants."
2021,17,20,New Orleans Saints,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ An upset win over Buccaneers -- even a bruised and battered Bucs team -- is worthy of significant praise, but can the Saints be taken seriously in the NFC given the limitations of their offense? Taysom Hill was a non-factor as both passer and runner of the football against Tampa Bay, and his high-stakes audition has been spotty, at best. New Orleans managed just 11 first downs on Sunday night on a paltry 3.5 yards per play. The three field goals produced by that output stood up because Cam Jordan and the New Orleans defense rattled Tom Brady before and after Mike Evans , Chris Godwin and Leonard Fournette all exited with injuries. Still, the Saints need to find more balance to play beyond the regular season."
2021,17,21,Las Vegas Raiders,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Style points aren't a thing. The Raiders needed to beat the COVID-19-compromised Browns to keep their playoff hopes alive -- and they achieved their goal with a 16-14 win in front of the Dawg Pound. Derek Carr led the Raiders down the field in the final seconds, and Daniel Carlson was once again money, drilling the 48-yard game-winning field goal as time expired. Carrâs latest crunch-time heroics came after the veteran QB appeared to lose the game by throwing an interception on Vegasâ penultimate possession. ""After that interception, I told the guys, âPlease, I promise weâll win it -- just get the ball back.' â The defense delivered the stop, and Carr kept his word . Another must-win game, this time against the Broncos, is up next ."
2021,17,22,Washington Football Team,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 18 The Football Team showed plenty of fight hanging tough against the Eagles on Tuesday night , but this is not a roster that can withstand many injuries -- or a full-blown COVID-19 outbreak . Washington jumped out to a 10-0 lead, but was outgained in yardage 519-237 and never found its footing with its top two quarterbacks taken out of action due to COVID-19 protocols. Washington needs to win out to have a chance at a playoff return, a nearly impossible ask for a team this compromised. âWeâre in a unique situation,"" wide receiver Terry McLaurin said. ""... We had the mindset going into the week that weâll play with whoever we have. This is the NFL, you have to be ready at all moments.â"
2021,17,23,Denver Broncos,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Broncos have told us who they are at this point: This is a team with a quality defense led by a coach in Vic Fangio who knows how to scramble up an opponentâs playbook. Unfortunately for the Broncos, teams are too often successful in scrambling Denverâs own attack, thus neutralizing the teamâs principle strength. Teddy Bridgewater exited Sundayâs damaging loss to the Bengals with a scary head injury that required a precautionary overnight hospital stay and puts his Week 16 availability in doubt. Meanwhile, the idea of Drew Lock stepping in to wake this dormant offense from its long winterâs nap feels like the plot of a particularly fanciful Lifetime Christmas movie."
2021,17,24,Seattle Seahawks,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 20 The Seahawks have felt out of sync all year. We saw it again in a 20-10 loss to the Rams on Tuesday that all but ended their season. The turning point came with eight minutes to play in the fourth quarter: D.K. Metcalf got behind Jalen Ramsey and was open for a potential game-tying touchdown strike. All Metcalf needed was an accurate rainbow deep ball from Wilson, the type of pass the quarterback has perfected over the past decade. But Wilsonâs pass hung up in the Los Angeles air, allowing Ramsey to get back in the play and force an incompletion. Wilson has been a special quarterback in his career, but his misfire in a critical juncture of the season was emblematic of the offenseâs year as a whole."
2021,17,25,Atlanta Falcons,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 24 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Falcons have hung around in the NFC playoff picture thanks to an unusual level of parity across the league this season combined with a series of narrow wins against mostly mediocre competition. But Atlanta has been exposed whenever it faces a team that profiles as an actual Super Bowl contender. The 49ers are just such a team, and they delivered a 31-13 thumping of Atlanta in an expected outcome. The Falcons can keep themselves in the postseason conversation with a win over the Lions on Sunday -- but itâs not crazy to say Detroit might be the superior team despite a worse record. The Falcons need serious work this offseason."
2021,17,26,Chicago Bears,4-10,"ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Previous rank: No. 26 The Bears deserve credit for fighting hard in Monday nightâs 17-9 loss to the Vikings. Chicago was missing a host of starters because of injuries and COVID-19 designations, but it battled to the end thanks to a stout defense that made life extremely difficult for Kirk Cousins (a career-worst 87 passing yards). If only Matt Nagy -- manic throughout the affair -- could unlock his own offense. Justin Fields and the Chicago attack couldnât find the end zone until a meaningless score as time expired, while five personal fouls (one committed by Nagy himself) furthered the narrative that this is a lost team wandering through the woods. Well, they are Bears."
2021,17,27,Detroit Lions,2-11-1,"Previous rank: No. 30 Dan Campbell has had his Lions fighting hard all season. On Sunday, they combined that consistent effort with great execution, resulting in a stunning blowout of the Cardinals. Jared Goff * continued his mastery against Kliff Kingsbury teams with three touchdown passes, while Detroit has found something in rookie receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown , who had eight catches for 90 yards with a score and now holds the single-season team record for catches by a rookie with 65. Detroit would be better off without a hot finish to its season from a draft-position perspective, but that goes against everything Campbell preaches inside the building. These Lions have heart -- and theyâre a dangerous opponent for any overconfident contender. * -- Goff was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Monday."
2021,17,28,Carolina Panthers,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ This has turned into a Murphyâs Law season for the Panthers: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. On Sunday in Buffalo, it was kicker Zane Gonzalez limping off the field after suffering a leg injury during pregame warmups. Carolina didnât need any extra challenges against a quality Buffalo opponent, and the resulting 31-14 loss could hardly be considered a surprise. Panthers fans who were thrilled to take their No. 1 jerseys out of storage should savor these last three games: Cam Newton âs time with the Panthers is certain to conclude after Week 18. What other changes are in store in Charlotte?"
2021,17,29,Houston Texans,3-11,"Previous rank: No. 31 When is a win actually a loss? Ask members of the Texans front office, who would probably admit over drinks at the holiday party that Sundayâs 30-16 victory over the Jaguars counted as a substantial setback for the organization. Houston swept the season series from Jacksonville, an act of bad-team-on-bad-team crime that pretty much ensures the Texans wonât have the No. 1 overall pick come April. Meanwhile, theyâre going to produce a 30 for 30 doc one day about Brandin Cooks â 1,000-yard season for the 2021 Houston Texans. What if I told you â¦"
2021,17,30,New York Giants,4-10,"Previous rank: No. 27 Daniel Jones â third NFL season is officially over after the Giants moved their quarterback to injured reserve with a neck injury. In some ways, Jonesâ latest season was a lot like the two before it: He flashed legit ability as a passer and runner, but the New York offense never consistently performed as the Giants remained an NFC also-ran. The job of Big Blue management is to discern how much of the teamâs struggles connect to Jones, and how much goes back to failures in coaching and talent acquisition around the former top-10 pick. Jonesâ future ultimately depends on who is running the show at the Meadowlands in a couple of months. Stay tuned."
2021,17,31,New York Jets,3-11,"Previous rank: No. 29 The Jets are deficient in so many areas that it seems reductive to put their ineptitude at the feet of a 22-year-old rookie quarterback. Still, Zach Wilson âs ongoing struggles cannot be ignored. New York managed three first downs in the second half of Sundayâs 31-24 loss to the Dolphins and the big-picture numbers paint a grim picture:  When Wilson missed four weeks with a knee injury, the offense, led by a coterie of backup QBs, averaged 24.5 points and 435.8 yards per game. In the four weeks since the No. 2 pickâs return to the lineup, the Jets have averaged 16.3 points and 257.8 yards per game. Wilson has yet to put together a full four quarters of quality play this season -- and heâs running out of time to do so."
2021,17,32,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-12,"Previous rank: No. 32 See? It wasnât Urban Meyerâs fault, after all. We kid â¦ but Sundayâs 30-16 loss to the Texans served as a reminder that Meyerâs general incompetence combined with Jacksonvilleâs young and talent-deficient roster made for one of the gnarliest failure stews in recent memory. The only real goals left this season: 1) Escape the final three weeks without any serious injury to Trevor Lawrence ; and 2) lock down the No. 1 overall pick for the second consecutive year. Facing the similarly downtrodden Jets puts an uncertain competitive glow upon Week 16 ."
2021,18,1,Green Bay Packers,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Matt LaFleur has been the head coach of the Green Bay Packers for nearly three full regular seasons now. The team has won 13 games in each of those seasons. Green Bay has never even lost consecutive regular-season games in LaFleur's time on the sideline -- he is overdue for some recognition among Coach of the Year voters. The latest win -- a Sunday night laugher over the Vikings -- ensures the NFC playoffs will go through Lambeau Field, where Green Bay was undefeated in the regular season. The table is set."
2021,18,2,Los Angeles Rams,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Championship teams know how to close, and that's exactly what the Rams did against the Ravens on Sunday . Matthew Stafford struggled with turnovers for the second straight week, but he was surgical on the 75-yard touchdown drive that put L.A. ahead with less than one minute remaining. Then it was the defense's turn: Von Miller made his biggest play as a Ram, a crushing sack of Tyler Huntley that all but ended Baltimore's hopes of getting the great Justin Tucker on the field for a game-winning field goal attempt. With a win over the rival Niners on Sunday , the Rams will be division champs."
2021,18,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 Tom Brady once again saved the day in leading the shorthanded Bucs to a comeback win over the Jets, but the talk after the game focused on a player who wasnât there when Tampa Bay was on its final march in the fourth quarter. Antonio Brown is history after a very public meltdown in New Jersey, and the Bucs have egg on their face for staying loyal to a player whoâs never been loyal to anyone but himself. Tampa Bayâs depth is being tested like never before in Bradyâs time with the team."
2021,18,4,Kansas City Chiefs,11-5,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Kansas City's defense had been the teamâs one constant this season: The unit held the team together when the offense was mired in a curious extended funk. The Chiefsâ attack has reemerged in recent weeks, but it was now the other side of the ball that didn't hold up its end in a damaging loss to the Bengals that may have cost Kansas City the top seed in the AFC . The deadly combination of Joe Burrow and JaâMarr Chase took advantage of defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuoloâs overaggressive approach, as Cincy piled up five plays of 30 yards or more. File this away for a potential January rematch."
2021,18,5,Cincinnati Bengals,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals are the most fun team in the NFL right now and second place isnât even in the rearview. Led by Joe Burrow (971 yards passing over the past two weeks) and JaâMarr Chase (a rookie-record 266 receiving yards in Week 17), Cincinnati has gone from AFC North afterthought to division champion and legit Super Bowl contender . âI said it in the preseason,â Burrow said after beating the Chiefs. âWe were talking about playoffs, and I said that if we were going to go to the playoffs, the easiest way to do that was to win the division. Everyone kind of laughed at us a little bit, but we knew what kind of team we had.â This team believes."
2021,18,6,Buffalo Bills,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Bills handled business at home against the Falcons, but not in the way you might have imagined. Stefon Diggs dropped a sure touchdown pass, and Josh Allen threw interceptions on three consecutive drives, but Buffalo got a surprise monster contribution from its running game in a closer-than-it-looks 29-15 win . The Bills piled up 233 yards on the ground, with Allen and Devin Singletary each scoring twice. Allen needs to clean up his play, but this was an overall a good sign for a Brian Daboll offense that could use more balance."
2021,18,7,Tennessee Titans,11-5,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Titans are one win away from home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs . This seems crazy considering the roller-coaster nature of their season, but theyâll have a clear path to the Super Bowl if they can beat the four-win Texans on Sunday . They blew the Dolphins off the field this past weekend, piling up 198 yards on the ground behind an offensive line that was finally healthy and together for the first time. Meanwhile, Derrick Henry should return soon to boost a running game that -- amazingly -- has held up fairly to extremely well since he left. This is not a team to discount."
2021,18,8,New England Patriots,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Patriots have been dropping unholy late-season 50-burgers on bad teams for years now, but thereâs something to be said for their ability to continue this party trick even with Tom Brady playing his home games 1,300 miles away from Foxborough. Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes in a 50-10 win over the Jaguars that clinched a playoff spo t and kept New England in the running for a division title with one week to play. No matter how the AFC East shakes out , a grudge match between the Pats and Bills feels inevitable. We plan to watch this game."
2021,18,9,Arizona Cardinals,11-5,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Boy, did the Cardinals need that . Arizona went to Dallas on Sunday and picked up the most important win of its season, a 25-22 conquest that breathed some much-needed confidence back into the team. Kyler Murray improved to 8-0 lifetime in games started at AT&T Stadium dating back to his high school hero days, while the beleaguered Cards defense held down a Cowboys attack that dropped 56 points on Washington seven days earlier. Arizona finished the regular season 8-1 away from State Farm Stadium -- good news for a team that could be on the road in the first week of the playoffs ."
2021,18,10,Dallas Cowboys,11-5,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Something continues to be slightly off in the mix for the Cowboys. An outrageous beatdown of a decimated Washington Football Team felt like ancient history by the second half of a 25-22 loss to the Cardinals in which the offense once again struggled to find its footing. Dak Prescott had five passes batted down at the line of scrimmage and struggled with his accuracy, while Michael Gallup was lost for the remainder of the year when he tore his ACL on a touchdown grab in the second quarter. A Week 18 matchup against the Eagles feels very important regardless of what it might mean to Dallas' playoff seeding."
2021,18,11,Indianapolis Colts,9-7,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ A change in the NFLâs COVID-19 protocols last week allowed Carson Wentz to play on Sunday against the Raiders, but the quarterback wasnât much of a help to his team in a disappointing last-second loss . Wentz delivered an uneven performance that once again leaves questions about how much Indy can trust its passer in the crucible of the playoffs. The Colts need to get there first, of course: Their simplest route is with a win in Jacksonville . Potentially disturbing fun fact: The Colts havenât won a road game against the Jaguars in more than seven years."
2021,18,12,San Francisco 49ers,9-7,"Previous rank: No. 13 Trey Lance stepped in for an injured Jimmy Garoppolo (thumb) on Sunday and did the job, leading the 49ers to a workmanlike 23-7 win over the Texans that puts San Francisco on the precipice of the playoffs . Now things get interesting: Lanceâs obvious upside makes him a potential X-factor, but Niners coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters after Sundayâs win that Jimmy G will draw the start against the Rams in the season finale -- if heâs healthy enough to do so. Would Shanahan really turn back to his physically compromised veteran with the season on the line? In reality, it will be a roll of the dice no matter which direction he goes."
2021,18,13,Los Angeles Chargers,9-7,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Chargers took care of business against an undermanned Broncos team. Now, itâs all in front of them . Beat the Raiders on Sunday night in Vegas and the Chargers will be back in the playoffs for the first time in three years. Fatalistic Bolts fans might feel like a prime-time win-and-in showcase sets up for more heartbreak for this star-crossed franchise. This is understandable given the history, but L.A. should enter that game with the deeper team and -- most importantly -- the superior quarterback. Itâs time to ride Justin Herbert to the tournament."
2021,18,14,Philadelphia Eagles,9-7,"Previous rank: No. 15 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Four straight wins punched a ticket to the postseason for the Eagles, but itâs fair to wonder if Philly is the NFCâs answer to the Dolphins -- another team that fattened up on the leagueâs have-nots. The Eagles' current win streak has been built on the backs of the Jets, the Giants and Washington (twice). Take a step back and youâll see Philly doesnât have a single win against a team that currently has a winning record. It will be the sensible play when Iggles fans pull those âunderdogâ masks out of their closets in a couple weeks."
2021,18,15,Las Vegas Raiders,9-7,"Previous rank: No. 16 This Raiders season will not be remembered for a late fade. In fact, Vegas has flipped the entire narrative on its ear. Rich Bisacciaâs team continued its unlikely rise with an upset win over the Colts , the teamâs third consecutive narrow victory over an AFC playoff hopeful. If the Raiders beat the Chargers on Sunday night in Vegas, they'll punch a playoff ticket and complete one of the more unlikely turnarounds in franchise history. The stakes are high for everyone, head coach included: Bisaccia is one win away from authoring a strong case to remove the interim label from his title."
2021,18,16,New Orleans Saints,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Saints are somehow still alive in the NFC playoff picture -- a testament to great coaching and the fight of a decimated team that has battled through adversity. The defense again played the starring role against the Panthers, piling up seven sacks of Sam Darnold in an 18-10 win at the Superdome. The pass rush was led by Cam Jordan , whoâs on a heater right now: The veteran had 3.5 sacks Sunday and has posted at least two sacks in three straight games. A win over the hated Falcons, coupled with a Niners loss to the Rams, puts New Orleans in the dance."
2021,18,17,Miami Dolphins,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Dolphins had the chance to show the doubters their seven-game winning streak wasnât merely the product of a soft schedule -- then delivered a flat performance against the Titans that validated all those naysayers. The defense was bullied by a Tennessee running game missing Derrick Henry , while Tua Tagovailoa struggled through a poor performance that featured two turnovers and nary an impact play when the outcome remained in doubt. When the Dolphins decision-makers need to decide what to do at the QB position this offseason, one can imagine Week 17 sticking in their heads."
2021,18,18,Pittsburgh Steelers,8-7-1,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Ben Roethlisberger was the story on Monday night at Heinz Field, but it was the Steelers' stars of today and tomorrow who kept the teamâs playoff hopes alive. Najee Harris ran for 188 yards and the game-sealing score, while T.J. Watt closed in on NFL history with four sacks (he has 21.5 for the season) in a 26-14 win over the Browns. Thatâs a season sweep of Cleveland, the team that ended Pittsburghâs 2020 season in embarrassing fashion last January . Big Benâs chances of extending his career beyond Sunday ride on a win over the Ravens coupled with a Colts loss to the Jaguars."
2021,18,19,Baltimore Ravens,8-8,Previous rank: No. 19 The Ravens saw their playoff chances dashed in cruel fashion by a Rams team that didnât grab its first lead until the final minute of game time. Baltimore lost because Tyler Huntley -- again filling in for an injured Lamar Jackson -- failed to turn red-zone trips into TDs; Baltimore went without an offensive touchdown for the first time in three years. The first half of the season was defined by narrow wins; the second by narrow losses. It evens out as 8-8 mediocrity.
2021,18,20,Cleveland Browns,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Browns probably werenât thrilled about being guests at Ben Roethlisberger âs emotional goodbye party at Heinz Field. The Cleveland defense held Big Ben to a comically low 2.7 yards per attempt on 46 passes, but the Browns' offense was inept in its own way. Baker Mayfield took nine sacks and threw two interceptions, while Kevin Stefanski deserves criticism for another strange game plan that included just 12 rush attempts for Nick Chubb , the teamâs best offensive player. If youâre talking about the most disappointing teams in the NFL this season, the Browns are absolutely part of the conversation."
2021,18,21,Minnesota Vikings,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 18 This Vikings season was fun â¦ until it wasnât. The playoff-eligible portion of the schedule ended with a blowout loss to -- who else? -- the Packers, who had no problem clinching the NFCâs No. 1 seed in a game Kirk Cousins watched from home after landing on the COVID-19 list at the most inopportune time. Cousins' four seasons in Minnesota have been defined by very good individual production â¦ and very average team results. Cousins is under contract for one more season, making him an intriguing trade chip if the Vikings decide to explore that road (and a team is willing to take on his hefty cap number )."
2021,18,22,Atlanta Falcons,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Falcons saw their slight playoff hopes drift away in the frigid air of Orchard Park in a 29-15 loss that could have turned out much differently with better execution. The Falcons forced three turnovers -- all Josh Allen interceptions -- but stalled on the Buffalo side of the field too many times to beat a Super Bowl contender on the road. Congrats are in order for Kyle Pitts , who exited the game with a hamstring injury but not before becoming the second rookie tight end in NFL history to surpass 1,000 yards receiving . The kid is a future superstar."

The defense balled out in a 29-3 win over the hapless Giants, and the star -- once again -- was Robert Quinn . With his 18th sack, the veteran pass rusher broke Hall of Famer Richard Dentâs franchise single-season mark (17.5). The record-breaker also put Quinn over 100 sacks for his career -- not bad for a guy who managed just two sacks in his disappointing 2020 debut with Chicago."

Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes in a 50-10 win over the Jaguars that clinched a playoff spo t and kept New England in the running for a division title with one week to play.

Kyler Murray improved to 8-0 lifetime in games started at AT&T Stadium dating back to his high school hero days, while the beleaguered Cards defense held down a Cowboys attack that dropped 56 points on Washington seven days earlier. Arizona finished the regular season 8-1 away from State Farm Stadium -- good news for a team that could be on the road in the first week of the playoffs ."

An outrageous beatdown of a decimated Washington Football Team felt like ancient history by the second half of a 25-22 loss to the Cardinals in which the offense once again struggled to find its footing. Dak Prescott had five passes batted down at the line of scrimmage and struggled with his accuracy, while Michael Gallup was lost for the remainder of the year when he tore his ACL on a touchdown grab in the second quarter. A Week 18 matchup against the Eagles feels very important regardless of what it might mean to Dallas' playoff seeding."

Wentz delivered an uneven performance that once again leaves questions about how much Indy can trust its passer in the crucible of the playoffs. The Colts need to get there first, of course: Their simplest route is with a win in Jacksonville .

Now things get interesting: Lanceâs obvious upside makes him a potential X-factor, but Niners coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters after Sundayâs win that Jimmy G will draw the start against the Rams in the season finale -- if heâs healthy enough to do so. Would Shanahan really turn back to his physically compromised veteran with the season on the line? In reality, it will be a roll of the dice no matter which direction he goes."

Beat the Raiders on Sunday night in Vegas and the Chargers will be back in the playoffs for the first time in three years. Fatalistic Bolts fans might feel like a prime-time win-and-in showcase sets up for more heartbreak for this star-crossed franchise. This is understandable given the history, but L.A. should enter that game with the deeper team and -- most importantly -- the superior quarterback. Itâs time to ride Justin Herbert to the tournament."

The Eagles' current win streak has been built on the backs of the Jets, the Giants and Washington (twice). Take a step back and youâll see Philly doesnât have a single win against a team that currently has a winning record. It will be the sensible play when Iggles fans pull those âunderdogâ masks out of their closets in a couple weeks."
2021,19,15,Las Vegas Raiders,9-7,"Previous rank: No. 16 This Raiders season will not be remembered for a late fade. In fact, Vegas has flipped the entire narrative on its ear. Rich Bisacciaâs team continued its unlikely rise with an upset win over the Colts , the teamâs third consecutive narrow victory over an AFC playoff hopeful. If the Raiders beat the Chargers on Sunday night in Vegas, they'll punch a playoff ticket and complete one of the more unlikely turnarounds in franchise history. The stakes are high for everyone, head coach included: Bisaccia is one win away from authoring a strong case to remove the interim label from his title."
2021,19,16,New Orleans Saints,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Saints are somehow still alive in the NFC playoff picture -- a testament to great coaching and the fight of a decimated team that has battled through adversity. The defense again played the starring role against the Panthers, piling up seven sacks of Sam Darnold in an 18-10 win at the Superdome. The pass rush was led by Cam Jordan , whoâs on a heater right now: The veteran had 3.5 sacks Sunday and has posted at least two sacks in three straight games. A win over the hated Falcons, coupled with a Niners loss to the Rams, puts New Orleans in the dance."
2021,19,17,Miami Dolphins,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Dolphins had the chance to show the doubters their seven-game winning streak wasnât merely the product of a soft schedule -- then delivered a flat performance against the Titans that validated all those naysayers. The defense was bullied by a Tennessee running game missing Derrick Henry , while Tua Tagovailoa struggled through a poor performance that featured two turnovers and nary an impact play when the outcome remained in doubt. When the Dolphins decision-makers need to decide what to do at the QB position this offseason, one can imagine Week 17 sticking in their heads."

Najee Harris ran for 188 yards and the game-sealing score, while T.J. Watt closed in on NFL history with four sacks (he has 21.5 for the season) in a 26-14 win over the Browns. Thatâs a season sweep of Cleveland, the team that ended Pittsburghâs 2020 season in embarrassing fashion last January . Big Benâs chances of extending his career beyond Sunday ride on a win over the Ravens coupled with a Colts loss to the Jaguars."
2021,19,19,Baltimore Ravens,8-8,Previous rank: No. 19 The Ravens saw their playoff chances dashed in cruel fashion by a Rams team that didnât grab its first lead until the final minute of game time. Baltimore lost because Tyler Huntley -- again filling in for an injured Lamar Jackson -- failed to turn red-zone trips into TDs; Baltimore went without an offensive touchdown for the first time in three years. The first half of the season was defined by narrow wins; the second by narrow losses. It evens out as 8-8 mediocrity.
2021,19,20,Cleveland Browns,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Browns probably werenât thrilled about being guests at Ben Roethlisberger âs emotional goodbye party at Heinz Field. The Cleveland defense held Big Ben to a comically low 2.7 yards per attempt on 46 passes, but the Browns' offense was inept in its own way. Baker Mayfield took nine sacks and threw two interceptions, while Kevin Stefanski deserves criticism for another strange game plan that included just 12 rush attempts for Nick Chubb , the teamâs best offensive player. If youâre talking about the most disappointing teams in the NFL this season, the Browns are absolutely part of the conversation."
2021,19,21,Minnesota Vikings,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 18 This Vikings season was fun â¦ until it wasnât. The playoff-eligible portion of the schedule ended with a blowout loss to -- who else? -- the Packers, who had no problem clinching the NFCâs No. 1 seed in a game Kirk Cousins watched from home after landing on the COVID-19 list at the most inopportune time. Cousins' four seasons in Minnesota have been defined by very good individual production â¦ and very average team results. Cousins is under contract for one more season, making him an intriguing trade chip if the Vikings decide to explore that road (and a team is willing to take on his hefty cap number )."
2021,19,22,Atlanta Falcons,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Falcons saw their slight playoff hopes drift away in the frigid air of Orchard Park in a 29-15 loss that could have turned out much differently with better execution. The Falcons forced three turnovers -- all Josh Allen interceptions -- but stalled on the Buffalo side of the field too many times to beat a Super Bowl contender on the road. Congrats are in order for Kyle Pitts , who exited the game with a hamstring injury but not before becoming the second rookie tight end in NFL history to surpass 1,000 yards receiving . The kid is a future superstar."

With his 18th sack, the veteran pass rusher broke Hall of Famer Richard Dentâs franchise single-season mark (17.5). The record-breaker also put Quinn over 100 sacks for his career -- not bad for a guy who managed just two sacks in his disappointing 2020 debut with Chicago."

The defense again played the starring role against the Panthers, piling up seven sacks of Sam Darnold in an 18-10 win at the Superdome. The pass rush was led by Cam Jordan , whoâs on a heater right now: The veteran had 3.5 sacks Sunday and has posted at least two sacks in three straight games. A win over the hated Falcons, coupled with a Niners loss to the Rams, puts New Orleans in the dance."

2022,0,19,Baltimore Ravens,8-8,Previous rank: No. 19 The Ravens saw their playoff chances dashed in cruel fashion by a Rams team that didnât grab its first lead until the final minute of game time. Baltimore lost because Tyler Huntley -- again filling in for an injured Lamar Jackson -- failed to turn red-zone trips into TDs; Baltimore went without an offensive touchdown for the first time in three years. The first half of the season was defined by narrow wins; the second by narrow losses. It evens out as 8-8 mediocrity.

The Cleveland defense held Big Ben to a comically low 2.7 yards per attempt on 46 passes, but the Browns' offense was inept in its own way. Baker Mayfield took nine sacks and threw two interceptions, while Kevin Stefanski deserves criticism for another strange game plan that included just 12 rush attempts for Nick Chubb , the teamâs best offensive player. If youâre talking about the most disappointing teams in the NFL this season, the Browns are absolutely part of the conversation."

Cousins' four seasons in Minnesota have been defined by very good individual production â¦ and very average team results. Cousins is under contract for one more season, making him an intriguing trade chip if the Vikings decide to explore that road (and a team is willing to take on his hefty cap number )."

The Falcons forced three turnovers -- all Josh Allen interceptions -- but stalled on the Buffalo side of the field too many times to beat a Super Bowl contender on the road. Congrats are in order for Kyle Pitts , who exited the game with a hamstring injury but not before becoming the second rookie tight end in NFL history to surpass 1,000 yards receiving .

With his 18th sack, the veteran pass rusher broke Hall of Famer Richard Dentâs franchise single-season mark (17.5). The record-breaker also put Quinn over 100 sacks for his career -- not bad for a guy who managed just two sacks in his disappointing 2020 debut with Chicago."

In the days leading up to the game, Wilson volunteered to the media that he hoped this wasn't his final game as a home player at Lumen Field. It was the first volley in what's shaping up to be an offseason of soapy melodrama for the Seahawks."
2022,0,25,Denver Broncos,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ The Broncos were not set up well to compete on Sunday against the Chargers. Vic Fangio's team was missing five defensive starters, as well as quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and wide receiver Jerry Jeudy . The predictable 34-13 loss clinched a fifth consecutive losing season for the Broncos, who have not returned to the playoffs since their victory in Super Bowl 50. The team will enter the offseason with uncertainty at the most vital sectors of an organization: at head coach, at quarterback, in ownership."

Heinicke has actually provided the Football Team some clarity with his up-and-down play this season: He makes perfect sense as a high-end backup, but heâs not a difference-maker at QB -- something this team hasnât had since Robert Griffin IIIâs rookie season back in 2012.

True story: Cooks now has six 1,000-yard seasons in his eight years in the NFL. Heâs also played with four teams in those eight years, which tells you this is a man who's been fighting a Rodney Dangerfield level of disrespect from the jump. We got you, bud."

But Jets fans should focus on the positives: Their undermanned team hung tough against the champs â¦ and Zach Wilson is showing real progress in the seasonâs homestretch. The rookie QB is now making the âlayupsâ (coach Robert Salehâs term for routine throws), and his game tape on Sunday was dotted with several wow passes that showed off his improved rhythm and confidence."

Letâs do it again, shall we? Sundayâs 51-29 setback to the Seahawks featured yet another standout game from rookie wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown , who scored two touchdowns (one receiving, one rushing) and tied Calvin Johnson for the longest streak of games with at least eight receptions in franchise history (heâs up to five with one week to play). Pretty nice company for the 22-year-old."
2022,0,30,Carolina Panthers,5-11,"Previous rank: No. 30 If the Panthers hoped Sam Darnold âs return to the lineup would pump some end-of-season optimism into the building, well, weâre not there yet. Darnold was under constant siege from a stout New Orleans front that piled up seven sacks and had no problem passing through Carolinaâs turnstyle offensive line. Darnold started the game with nine consecutive completions, but he faded with the rest of the Panthers attack, culminating with an ugly game-sealing pick in the final minute of an 18-10 loss . Carolina needs a total upheaval of its offensive line before it makes any final judgement on the quarterback playing behind it."

Theyâve been non-competitive in recent weeks, but Joe Judge remained defiantly optimistic in a postgame press conference/winding 11-minute monologue that didnât do him any favors. ""This ain't a team that's having fistfights on the sidelines,"" the coach said after a 29-3 loss to the Bears. ""This ain't some clown show organization or something else, OK? You talk about the foundation built, you talk about the things that -- the toughest thing to change in a team, the toughest thing to change in a club, is the way people think."" Judge sees foundation and a culture change , but does ownership really see progress in the past two years?

2022,0,32,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-14,"Previous rank: No. 32 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Trevor Lawrence 's rookie season has gone terribly, and there were moments during the Jaguars' latest lopsided loss -- this time a 50-10 shellacking at the hands of the Patriots -- where we couldn't help but wonder what lasting effects this year might have on the No. 1 overall pick. Lawrence threw three more interceptions on Sunday; his only highlight came on a garbage-time screen pass TD that ended a streak of 184 pass attempts without a score. Given Lawrence's generational talents and the melodrama that conspired to melt his debut campaign, it's fair to say no team has a more important offseason in front of it than Jacksonville."

The team has won 13 games in each of those seasons. Green Bay has never even lost consecutive regular-season games in LaFleur's time on the sideline -- he is overdue for some recognition among Coach of the Year voters. The latest win -- a Sunday night laugher over the Vikings -- ensures the NFC playoffs will go through Lambeau Field, where Green Bay was undefeated in the regular season. The table is set."

Matthew Stafford struggled with turnovers for the second straight week, but he was surgical on the 75-yard touchdown drive that put L.A. ahead with less than one minute remaining. Then it was the defense's turn: Von Miller made his biggest play as a Ram, a crushing sack of Tyler Huntley that all but ended Baltimore's hopes of getting the great Justin Tucker on the field for a game-winning field goal attempt. With a win over the rival Niners on Sunday , the Rams will be division champs."
2022,1,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 Tom Brady once again saved the day in leading the shorthanded Bucs to a comeback win over the Jets, but the talk after the game focused on a player who wasnât there when Tampa Bay was on its final march in the fourth quarter.

If the Raiders beat the Chargers on Sunday night in Vegas, they'll punch a playoff ticket and complete one of the more unlikely turnarounds in franchise history. The stakes are high for everyone, head coach included: Bisaccia is one win away from authoring a strong case to remove the interim label from his title."
2022,1,16,New Orleans Saints,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Saints are somehow still alive in the NFC playoff picture -- a testament to great coaching and the fight of a decimated team that has battled through adversity. The defense again played the starring role against the Panthers, piling up seven sacks of Sam Darnold in an 18-10 win at the Superdome. The pass rush was led by Cam Jordan , whoâs on a heater right now: The veteran had 3.5 sacks Sunday and has posted at least two sacks in three straight games. A win over the hated Falcons, coupled with a Niners loss to the Rams, puts New Orleans in the dance."
2022,1,17,Miami Dolphins,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Dolphins had the chance to show the doubters their seven-game winning streak wasnât merely the product of a soft schedule -- then delivered a flat performance against the Titans that validated all those naysayers. The defense was bullied by a Tennessee running game missing Derrick Henry , while Tua Tagovailoa struggled through a poor performance that featured two turnovers and nary an impact play when the outcome remained in doubt. When the Dolphins decision-makers need to decide what to do at the QB position this offseason, one can imagine Week 17 sticking in their heads."
2022,1,18,Pittsburgh Steelers,8-7-1,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Ben Roethlisberger was the story on Monday night at Heinz Field, but it was the Steelers' stars of today and tomorrow who kept the teamâs playoff hopes alive. Najee Harris ran for 188 yards and the game-sealing score, while T.J. Watt closed in on NFL history with four sacks (he has 21.5 for the season) in a 26-14 win over the Browns. Thatâs a season sweep of Cleveland, the team that ended Pittsburghâs 2020 season in embarrassing fashion last January . Big Benâs chances of extending his career beyond Sunday ride on a win over the Ravens coupled with a Colts loss to the Jaguars."
2022,1,19,Baltimore Ravens,8-8,Previous rank: No. 19 The Ravens saw their playoff chances dashed in cruel fashion by a Rams team that didnât grab its first lead until the final minute of game time. Baltimore lost because Tyler Huntley -- again filling in for an injured Lamar Jackson -- failed to turn red-zone trips into TDs; Baltimore went without an offensive touchdown for the first time in three years. The first half of the season was defined by narrow wins; the second by narrow losses. It evens out as 8-8 mediocrity.
2022,1,20,Cleveland Browns,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Browns probably werenât thrilled about being guests at Ben Roethlisberger âs emotional goodbye party at Heinz Field. The Cleveland defense held Big Ben to a comically low 2.7 yards per attempt on 46 passes, but the Browns' offense was inept in its own way. Baker Mayfield took nine sacks and threw two interceptions, while Kevin Stefanski deserves criticism for another strange game plan that included just 12 rush attempts for Nick Chubb , the teamâs best offensive player. If youâre talking about the most disappointing teams in the NFL this season, the Browns are absolutely part of the conversation."
2022,1,21,Minnesota Vikings,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 18 This Vikings season was fun â¦ until it wasnât. The playoff-eligible portion of the schedule ended with a blowout loss to -- who else? -- the Packers, who had no problem clinching the NFCâs No. 1 seed in a game Kirk Cousins watched from home after landing on the COVID-19 list at the most inopportune time. Cousins' four seasons in Minnesota have been defined by very good individual production â¦ and very average team results. Cousins is under contract for one more season, making him an intriguing trade chip if the Vikings decide to explore that road (and a team is willing to take on his hefty cap number )."
2022,1,22,Atlanta Falcons,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Falcons saw their slight playoff hopes drift away in the frigid air of Orchard Park in a 29-15 loss that could have turned out much differently with better execution. The Falcons forced three turnovers -- all Josh Allen interceptions -- but stalled on the Buffalo side of the field too many times to beat a Super Bowl contender on the road. Congrats are in order for Kyle Pitts , who exited the game with a hamstring injury but not before becoming the second rookie tight end in NFL history to surpass 1,000 yards receiving . The kid is a future superstar."

The defense balled out in a 29-3 win over the hapless Giants, and the star -- once again -- was Robert Quinn . With his 18th sack, the veteran pass rusher broke Hall of Famer Richard Dentâs franchise single-season mark (17.5). The record-breaker also put Quinn over 100 sacks for his career -- not bad for a guy who managed just two sacks in his disappointing 2020 debut with Chicago."
2022,1,24,Seattle Seahawks,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Where has this version of the offense been the past two months? Russell Wilson had his best game since finger surgery, throwing four touchdown passes -- three to DK Metcalf -- while running back Rashaad Penny 's career rejuvenation continued with 170 yards and two touchdowns in a 51-29 blowout of the Lions. In the days leading up to the game, Wilson volunteered to the media that he hoped this wasn't his final game as a home player at Lumen Field. It was the first volley in what's shaping up to be an offseason of soapy melodrama for the Seahawks."
2022,1,25,Denver Broncos,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ The Broncos were not set up well to compete on Sunday against the Chargers. Vic Fangio's team was missing five defensive starters, as well as quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and wide receiver Jerry Jeudy . The predictable 34-13 loss clinched a fifth consecutive losing season for the Broncos, who have not returned to the playoffs since their victory in Super Bowl 50. The team will enter the offseason with uncertainty at the most vital sectors of an organization: at head coach, at quarterback, in ownership."
2022,1,26,Washington Football Team,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Taylor Heinicke had a chance to put a dagger in the heart of a rival on Sunday but instead threw an interception that sealed another Washington loss, the teamâs fourth in a row. Heinicke has actually provided the Football Team some clarity with his up-and-down play this season: He makes perfect sense as a high-end backup, but heâs not a difference-maker at QB -- something this team hasnât had since Robert Griffin IIIâs rookie season back in 2012. It will be interesting to see what Washington does with a top-10 pick in Aprilâs draft ."
2022,1,27,Houston Texans,4-12,"Previous rank: No. 27 Letâs give some love to the NFLâs most under-appreciated playmaker: Brandin Cooks . The veteran wideout had Houstonâs lone touchdown in Sundayâs loss to the 49ers and has quietly put together yet another productive season in a career filled with them. True story: Cooks now has six 1,000-yard seasons in his eight years in the NFL. Heâs also played with four teams in those eight years, which tells you this is a man who's been fighting a Rodney Dangerfield level of disrespect from the jump. We got you, bud."
2022,1,28,New York Jets,4-12,"Previous rank: No. 29 After it was over, the focus of Bucs 28, Jets 24 was on Antonio Brown âs antics , Tom Brady âs heroics , and a New York fourth-down play call gone horribly awry. But Jets fans should focus on the positives: Their undermanned team hung tough against the champs â¦ and Zach Wilson is showing real progress in the seasonâs homestretch. The rookie QB is now making the âlayupsâ (coach Robert Salehâs term for routine throws), and his game tape on Sunday was dotted with several wow passes that showed off his improved rhythm and confidence."
2022,1,29,Detroit Lions,2-13-1,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Weâve all had such a fun time rooting for the plucky, upstart Lions that we seem to paper over the grisly blowout losses that have dotted their 2-13-1 season. Letâs do it again, shall we? Sundayâs 51-29 setback to the Seahawks featured yet another standout game from rookie wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown , who scored two touchdowns (one receiving, one rushing) and tied Calvin Johnson for the longest streak of games with at least eight receptions in franchise history (heâs up to five with one week to play). Pretty nice company for the 22-year-old."
2022,1,30,Carolina Panthers,5-11,"Previous rank: No. 30 If the Panthers hoped Sam Darnold âs return to the lineup would pump some end-of-season optimism into the building, well, weâre not there yet. Darnold was under constant siege from a stout New Orleans front that piled up seven sacks and had no problem passing through Carolinaâs turnstyle offensive line. Darnold started the game with nine consecutive completions, but he faded with the rest of the Panthers attack, culminating with an ugly game-sealing pick in the final minute of an 18-10 loss . Carolina needs a total upheaval of its offensive line before it makes any final judgement on the quarterback playing behind it."
2022,1,31,New York Giants,4-12,"Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Giants will end another lost season as the worst team in the NFC. Theyâve been non-competitive in recent weeks, but Joe Judge remained defiantly optimistic in a postgame press conference/winding 11-minute monologue that didnât do him any favors. ""This ain't a team that's having fistfights on the sidelines,"" the coach said after a 29-3 loss to the Bears. ""This ain't some clown show organization or something else, OK? You talk about the foundation built, you talk about the things that -- the toughest thing to change in a team, the toughest thing to change in a club, is the way people think."" Judge sees foundation and a culture change , but does ownership really see progress in the past two years? If anything, Big Blue has regressed."
2022,1,32,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-14,"Previous rank: No. 32 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Trevor Lawrence 's rookie season has gone terribly, and there were moments during the Jaguars' latest lopsided loss -- this time a 50-10 shellacking at the hands of the Patriots -- where we couldn't help but wonder what lasting effects this year might have on the No. 1 overall pick. Lawrence threw three more interceptions on Sunday; his only highlight came on a garbage-time screen pass TD that ended a streak of 184 pass attempts without a score. Given Lawrence's generational talents and the melodrama that conspired to melt his debut campaign, it's fair to say no team has a more important offseason in front of it than Jacksonville."
2022,2,1,Buffalo Bills,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ On Thursday night at SoFi Stadium, long after most Rams fans had headed for the exits, thousands of visiting Bills supporters hung around to soak in the feeling of an extremely satisfying victory. Sean McDermott's team had drubbed the defending champions, 31-10 , exorcising the demons of January's excruciating Divisional Round loss in Kansas City. Josh Allen played like an MVP favorite, and the Bills' front seven dominated the trenches, making life miserable for Matthew Stafford . On paper entering this season, it looked like Buffalo had the most complete team in football. One game in, the on-field product supports that notion."
2022,2,2,Kansas City Chiefs,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 7 No Tyreek Hill ? No problem for Patrick Mahomes , who reminded everyone of his otherworldly brilliance in a blowout of the overmatched Cardinals in Arizona. Mahomes completed passes to nine different receivers and threw five touchdown passes, connecting with four different targets for scores. The heart of the attack remained Travis Kelce (8/121/1 on nine targets), but an eye-opening 2022 debut from Clyde Edwards-Helaire makes you wonder if Andy Reidâs new-look attack will turn the running back into the impact chess piece Kansas City envisioned when it made him a first-round pick in 2020. It took only one dominating performance to put the ghosts of the 2021 postseason in the rearview. The Chiefs are ready to roll."
2022,2,3,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ Todd Bowles built his reputation as a defensive wizard. In his debut as Buccaneers head coach, it was his side of the ball that dominated throughout a 19-3 win over the Cowboys at Jerrah World. Tampa Bay's defense put the clamps down on Dallas' underwhelming receiving corps and pressured Dak Prescott relentlessly before sending the QB to the X-ray room with a busted thumb . Tom Brady and the offense moved the ball well and controlled the flow of the game, even if Tampa Bay's performance in the red zone left plenty of room for improvement. Injuries to LT Donovan Smith (elbow) and WR Chris Godwin (hamstring) aren't ideal -- Godwin's expected to miss a few weeks -- but Julio Jones looked like, well, Julio Jones in his Bucs debut. If the seven-time Pro Bowler can stay healthy, look out."
2022,2,4,Los Angeles Rams,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 That's not how the start of a title defense is supposed to go. On a brutally steamy night in Los Angeles, the Rams got run out of their own building by a Bills team that looked like the better, hungrier group. There was no one single culprit in the 31-10 beatdown : Matthew Stafford threw three interceptions, the offensive line was manhandled, Aaron Donald was neutralized, and the secondary surrendered too many big plays. After the game, Sean McVay said his squad had been humbled on a night that began as a celebration: ""We weren't ready to go. I take a lot of pride in that, and that's on me."""
2022,2,5,Los Angeles Chargers,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Chargers received impact performances from a host of newcomers in a promising 24-19 win over the Raiders. TE Gerald Everett and WR DeAndre Carter both scored touchdowns, while OLB Khalil Mack had three of L.A.'s six sacks of a rattled Derek Carr at SoFi Stadium. Justin Herbert was predictably great, finding ways to move the offense even after Keenan Allen left the game with a hamstring injury . Allen's availability is in doubt on Thursday night for a huge early-season litmus test against the Chiefs at Arrowhead. Will J.C. Jackson , the team's prized free-agent addition at cornerback, make his debut? The Bolts sure could use him with that Mahomes guy looming."
2022,2,6,Baltimore Ravens,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Ravens weren't able to run the ball much in their season opener, but consider it a positive sign that didn't doom their attack in a convincing win over the Jets. Lamar Jackson was on target as a passer, connecting on three scores -- two to Devin Duvernay , who delivered an intriguing performance for a team in need of playmakers. Baltimore's defense dominated, routinely collapsing the pocket on old friend Joe Flacco . When the Jets did move the ball, the Ravens bowed up near midfield and forced timely turnovers. They won't all be this easy, but this was a nice start for Baltimore after the bitter frustrations of 2021."
2022,2,7,Minnesota Vikings,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Here's something dumb: A wide receiver has never won the MVP award. NEVER. Could Justin Jefferson end the drought? The third-year superstar was untouchable on Sunday against the Packers, piling up nine catches for 184 yards and two touchdowns in a 23-7 win over the three-time defending division champs. According to ESPN , Jefferson averaged 4 yards of separation on his 11 targets, gaining 138 of his receiving yards on plays when he had at least 3 yards of separation -- next-level dominance. Give some credit to new coach and play caller Kevin O'Connell, who moved Jefferson around the field and appears ready to use his top receiver in more imaginative ways than previously seen in Minnesota. Jefferson is a cheat code, and the Vikes look primed to take full advantage."
2022,2,8,Green Bay Packers,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 Christian Watson toasted Patrick Peterson on a deep route and had nothing but green in front of him as a perfectly thrown Aaron Rodgers spiral entered his orbit. The ball clanked off Watsonâs hands , however, an ominous first play from scrimmage for the 2022 Packers. Green Bayâs attack was held to a single scoring drive in a dispiriting 23-7 loss to the Vikings on Sunday. Watching in real time, it was hard not to think about moments in the game when Rodgers would have looked to Davante Adams to get the offense going. Itâs a transition period for the attack, but trust Rodgers to figure things out in time."
2022,2,9,Cincinnati Bengals,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals had no business beating the Steelers on Sunday. They also had no business losing to the Steelers on Sunday. It was a weird one. The 23-20 overtime defeat was as disappointing as it will ultimately be memorable -- Joe Burrow had a career-worst five turnovers, including four interceptions -- but was also set up to be the hero (along with JaâMarr Chase , of course) had Evan McPherson received some help from the backup long snapper on gimme kicks late in regulation and overtime. Burrow's hot-and-cold performance isnât a concern -- the offensive line is another story. Burrow (sacked seven times) continues to get hit; the Bengals continue to flirt with disaster."
2022,2,10,Philadelphia Eagles,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ This offense is going to be a problem for teams. The Eagles rolled up 455 yards on 10 possessions against the Lions in a 38-35 win , taking it to the Hard Knocks darlings through the air and on the ground in an entertaining shootout at Ford Field. New No. 1 wide receiver A.J. Brown was an immediate-impact playmaker, piling up 10 catches for 155 yards on 13 targets. Meanwhile, the tandem of Jalen Hurts and Miles Sanders rushing behind a stout offensive line has the potential to turn Philly into a matchup nightmare for any opponent -- not just a young and inexperienced defense like Detroitâs. Talent > Grit."
2022,2,11,San Francisco 49ers,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 The 49ers refused to get out of their own way against the Bears. San Francisco committed 12 penalties for 99 yards, turned the ball over during a fateful fourth-quarter swoon and generally looked as sloppy as the rain-drowned Soldier Field turf in a 19-10 loss . Trey Lance once again flashed playmaker chops with his legs, but he missed a touchdown pass to Tyler Kroft on the second possession and generally still looks like a work in progress. Then again, the miserable conditions in Chicago demand a halt on any rush to judgment on the offense. A disappointing start no doubt, but letâs see what this team looks like this Sunday against the Seahawks . ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿"
2022,2,12,New Orleans Saints,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 13 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Thatâs the type of Jameis Winston performance that will make believers out of doubters. The polarizing quarterback was shut down along with the rest of the Saintsâ offense for the better part of three quarters against the Falcons, but Winston went off on back-to-back drives that changed the game in the fourth quarter. Winston was 11 of 12 for 156 yards with two touchdown passes to Michael Thomas during that stretch, capping his day with a final march that set up Wil Lutz âs game-winning field goal. While Marcus Mariota -- the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 draft -- self-destructed in the final period, Winston -- the No. 1 pick that year -- was at his best. An eye-opener."
2022,2,13,Miami Dolphins,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 19 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Dolphins opened their season with encouraging performances on both sides of the ball in a 20-7 win over the Patriots . Tyreek Hill and Tua Tagovailoa displayed the chemistry teased during the summer, connecting eight times for 94 yards on 12 targets, while the defense scored a touchdown ( welcome to town, Melvin Ingram ) and held New Englandâs undercooked attack to just 271 yards and a single scoring drive. Want a sign of the times in the shifting AFC East? Tagovailoa is now 4-0 in his career against Bill Belichick. Miami has surpassed New England -- Buffalo is the new target."
2022,2,14,Las Vegas Raiders,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Not good enough. After a summer of hype around a Raiders offense now armed with a legit No. 1 receiver in Davante Adams , the Silver & Black attack went out and delivered a tepid performance in a 24-19 loss to the rival Chargers at SoFi Stadium. The offensive line struggled to protect Derek Carr (five sacks), while the quarterback missed on too many throws and was careless with the football (three interceptions and two fumbles). In a division with Justin Herbert , Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson , this type of quarterback play is the recipe for disappointment in the desert. The pressure is already on this Sunday against the Cardinals ."
2022,2,15,Indianapolis Colts,0-0-1,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Sunday wasnât a good day for kickers across the league, and you have to wonder how much rope Rodrigo Blankenship has left in Indy after his badly pushed field-goal attempt in overtime forced the Colts to settle for a 20-20 tie with the Texans. Blankenship, who also had a kickoff go out of bounds, is a weak point for a team that figures to play its fair share of close games this season. Meanwhile, Matt Ryan will eventually be seen as an upgrade over Carson Wentz , but this wasnât the start Colts fans were expecting after a summer of Matty Ice hype. Ryan -- with a big helping hand from Jonathan Taylor -- did wipe out a 20-3 fourth-quarter deficit, but failing to stack a win against the lowly Texans is the type of thing that can haunt a team come January."
2022,2,16,Denver Broncos,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Nathaniel Hackett worked his whole career to get to Monday night. Unfortunately, it wonât be a night heâll recall fondly. The new Broncos coach watched his team lose two fumbles at the enemy 1-yard line, then found himself at the center of criticism for poor clock management in the final seconds of an ugly 17-16 loss to the Seahawks. Russell Wilson threw for 340 yards and a touchdown in his Denver debut, but he also bore some responsibility for a sloppy effort that included too many penalties and not enough execution at the most crucial moments of the game. Denver was a heavily hyped team following the blockbuster trade that brought Wilson to town. Monday night felt like the hangover after a summer-long party."
2022,2,17,Tennessee Titans,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Titans entered Sunday hoping to wash away the taste of Januaryâs ugly playoff loss to the Bengals . Instead, Tennessee was left to process another game it probably should have won but didnât. Against the Giants , Ryan Tannehill looked like a quarterback who no longer has a No. 1 wide receiver, Derrick Henry looked like a running back whoâs still working his way back to peak form, and the defense looked like a unit that was good -- but not good enough -- when the game was hanging in the balance. Throw in a grim field-goal miss by Randy Bullock in the final seconds, and the Titans had cooked up a recipe for supreme frustration in Week 1."
2022,2,18,Seattle Seahawks,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 24 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Geno Smith was clearly the undercard on Monday Night Football , a contest hyped up as Russell Wilson âs Broncos debut and grudge match against Pete Carroll and the Seahawks. But it was the journeyman QB out of West Virginia who got the postgame-interview treatment after mind-boggling clock management by Wilson and new Broncos head coach Nathaniel Hackett helped secure a 17-16 Seattle win . Geno went 23-of-28 passing for 195 yards and two touchdowns -- nearly all of the production coming in the first half -- and avoided the crushing turnovers that have haunted him in the past, as the Seattle defense repeatedly turned away the Denver attack from in close. All and all, a fun night at Lumen Field, especially for the other QB . Said Geno after the game: âThey wrote me off. I ainât write back, though.â"
2022,2,19,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Letâs start with the positives: The Steelers forced Joe Burrow into five turnovers, the front seven piled up six sacks and Chris Boswell âs long field goal secured an overtime win over the defending AFC champion Bengals in one of the craziest season openers in recent history. The negatives are ominous, however: The offense was largely stagnant under Mitch Trubisky , Najee Harris exited the game with a foot injury and reigning Defensive Player of the Year T.J. Watt appears likely to miss at least several weeks after suffering a pectoral injury in the final seconds of regulation. Sometimes even the most dramatic of wins can feel like a loss. UPDATE: Harris said on Tuesday that he will play in Week 2 ."
2022,2,20,Cleveland Browns,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Browns have landed themselves a major weapon in Cade York , the fourth-round rookie kicker out of LSU who was absolutely nails in Clevelandâs 26-24 win over Baker Mayfield and the Panthers in Charlotte. Yorkâs 58-yard field goal with eight seconds remaining would have been good from 10 yards further (at least!), the final kick in a perfect 4 for 4 day. Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt carried the offense, something theyâll be tasked with doing for the entirety of Jacoby Brissett âs limited time as the starting quarterback. The best that can be said about Brissett? He avoided the killer turnover. But itâs clear opponents will be able to stack the box against Cleveland with impunity until Deshaun Watson returns from his suspension ."
2022,2,21,New York Giants,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ With one bold decision, coach Brian Daboll won over the hearts and minds of millions of Giants fans in the tri-state area. Instead of playing for overtime against the favored Titans, Daboll put the ball in the hands of Saquon Barkley , who took in the two-point conversion with 1:06 to play in a thrilling 21-20 win in Nashville. That level of bravery all but guaranteed the Football Gods would be with the Giants when Randy Bullock âs subsequent field-goal attempt hooked wide left as time ran out. What a way to start a season, and Barkleyâs performance is a reason for legitimate hope at the Meadowlands. The injury-plagued former No. 2 overall pick looked all the way back, piling up 194 total yards in a dominant performance that recalled his amazing rookie year. We have a very early Comeback Player of the Year favorite."
2022,2,22,Arizona Cardinals,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 16 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Maybe it was just a bad day . Maybe sometimes a team catches Patrick Mahomes on the wrong Sunday and thereâs simply nothing anyone can do. But then thereâs the other possibility: The Cardinals really are that far behind the top teams in the league like the Chiefs. The offense looked like it was trapped in the dark ages as Andy Reid unlocked new worlds, while the defense was simply overmatched and embarrassed by a Kansas City team that doesnât even have Tyreek Hill anymore. There might not be another team in more dire need of a strong Week 2 performance than the Cardinals."
2022,2,23,New England Patriots,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 18 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ After a summer of bad buzz surrounding the offense, the Patriots went out on Sunday and delivered a tepid performance that justified all the panic in New England. The Pats' attack had moments when it was able to move the ball -- primarily on the ground -- but after four quarters, the team had managed a single scoring drive in a 20-7 loss to the Dolphins. To make matters worse, Mac Jones missed his postgame media obligation so he could undergo X-rays on his back. Jones appears to have dodged serious injury , but the scare serves as a reminder that any hope of success this season will hinge on the teamâs ability to keep the young quarterback upright. The Pats have work to do."
2022,2,24,Washington Commanders,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 30 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Commanders got the full Carson Wentz treatment in his Washington debut. The veteran quarterback threw two early touchdown passes to put the Commanders in, well, command, then tossed a pair of interceptions on successive plays that put the game on the brink. But credit Wentz for not letting the game spiral away. He led Washington on two more touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to secure a 28-22 victory and win over the Commanders faithful -- for the time being, anyway. The Wentz experience has always been a roller coaster. Another NFL fan base is buckled in with no chance to exit the ride. Hold tight."
2022,2,25,Chicago Bears,1-0,"Previous rank: No. 32 Playing in soaking-wet conditions at Soldier Field, the Bears' offense looked pitiful in the first two quarters of their opener against the 49ers. How bad? Chicago managed 26 yards on its first 20 plays from scrimmage and went into the half without a catch from a wide receiver or tight end -- the first time thatâs happened for the Bears since 1991, per the FOX game broadcast. But Chicago showed gumption, taking advantage of a host of unforced errors by San Francisco to put together three touchdown drives in the second half to score the upset . Justin Fields sparked the comeback with the type of scramble play thatâs fast become his signature -- the second-year QB spun away from the rush, found some open space, then threw across the field to Dante Pettis , who scored from 51 yards out . Fields has playmaker traits that produce enough electricity to raise a team from the dead."
2022,2,26,Detroit Lions,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Lions opened the season by hanging until the final minute with a loaded Eagles team that has the look of a potential NFC superpower. That counts as progress for Dan Campbellâs team, which showed resolve in a 38-35 loss at a raucous Ford Field. There will be a time when merely hanging with a tough opponent wonât be good enough, but for now, the Lions appear on the right track. Keep an eye on DâAndre Swift , who ran for 144 yards and looks fully primed to deliver the biggest running back season by a Lions player since Barry Sanders was in town. The defense is an obvious work in progress, but the Detroit attack looks ready to go."

The chief concerns about the Cowboys entering the season -- offensive line stability and wide receiver depth, in particular -- proved to be very real problems, while Dak Prescott struggled through a poor performance before exiting with a thumb injury requiring surgery . With Prescott on the shelf until at least mid-October , the 'Boys take a massive plunge in these here rankings. Given what weâve seen from backup QB Cooper Rush , you can make a case that Dallas suddenly has one of the worst offenses in football. Bad times in Big D."
2022,2,28,Houston Texans,0-0-1,"Previous rank: No. 27 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Lovie Smith wonât say it, but when he sends the punt unit on the field on 4th-and-3 at midfield with less than one minute to play in overtime, heâs telling the world, âI donât think my offense is good enough.â Settling for a tie when you have a chance to score a major Week 1 upset is a disappointing way for your new head coach to announce his arrival, but itâs not like Smith was without justification . The Davis Mills -led offense produced just 12 yards in the fourth quarter, allowing the Colts to erase a 20-3 deficit. âWhen you get a lead like that, good things had to happen on both sides of the football and special teams,"" Smith said. âSo thatâs what weâll build on."" Ugh."
2022,2,29,Carolina Panthers,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 23 Baker Mayfield salvaged what was shaping up to be a dreadful Panthers debut with some fourth-quarter heroics, scoring on a 7-yard scramble and then hitting Robbie Anderson on a 75-yard touchdown bomb before leading Carolina to the go-ahead field goal in the final minutes. It still wasnât enough to secure the win, or wipe away the grim nature of the first three quarters of his first start as Sam Darnold âs replacement in Charlotte. Itâs fair to wonder why Matt Rhule sent Mayfield into this grudge match against his former team without a strong game plan in place for Christian McCaffrey , the running back dynamo who had just 14 touches. CMC is healthy and freakishly dynamic -- good God, use the man while you can!"
2022,2,30,Atlanta Falcons,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Falcons must learn how to close games. A season ago, they struggled to stop offenses and score points in the fourth quarter -- and that trait resurfaced in a hard-to-swallow 27-26 loss to the rival Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Atlanta had a 26-10 lead with less than 13 minutes to play before surrendering three straight scoring drives to cough up the lead. Marcus Mariota had two key fumbles in the second half -- one was lost deep in Saints territory and another, while recovered by Atlanta, led to a failed third-and-short conversion with the team ahead in the final minute. ""You buried us in May. Bury us again,â coach Arthur Smith said after the loss . âWe don't care. We'll get back to work."""
2022,2,31,Jacksonville Jaguars,0-1,"Previous rank: No. 29 The  Jaguars looked like a more professional operation than the one that debuted with Urban Meyer last year (low bar alert!), but Sunday was a reminder the team has to learn how to win. Trevor Lawrence flashed traits of a franchise cornerstone, but his fourth-quarter interception was another example of the young quarterback trying to force the issue rather than live for another down. That was Lawrenceâs only turnover on the day, though he also missed an open Travis Etienne on a would-be touchdown in what was an uneven performance overall. Etienne would later drop a walk-in touchdown pass on fourth-and-goal. That kind of day for the Jags, who profile as a frisky but frustrating product."

Instead, it was âSame Old Jetsâ in a packed house of rain-soaked and frustrated fans at the Meadowlands on Sunday. Joe Flacco struggled to move the offense , the running backs, wide receivers and tight ends couldnât hold onto the ball, and the defense lost its nerve after a strong first-half performance. Jets coach Robert Saleh praised his teamâs effort level after the lopsided loss to the Ravens, but that messaging no longer flies for a fan base thatâs been watching bad football for the better part of a decade. It's time for the Saleh and Joe Douglas regime to deliver tangible results -- Week 1 was an ominous sign."
2022,3,1,Buffalo Bills,2-0,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Monday night's 41-7 pasting of the Titans was another loud message to the NFL that the measuring stick for all teams can be found in Western New York. Josh Allen threw for 317 yards and four touchdowns in just three quarters of work, while Stefon Diggs piled up 12 catches for 148 yards and three scores ... also in just three quarters of work. Throw in a Matt Milano pick-six and a wall of blue surrounding Derrick Henry every time the Titans back touched the ball, and, well, this was as pure a distillation of dominance as we might see all season. Two weeks in, and the Bills exist in a class of their own."
2022,3,2,Kansas City Chiefs,2-0,"Previous rank: No. 2 It wasn't always pretty, but the Chiefs took care of business against a rival who came uncomfortably close to sending shockwaves through the AFC West. The hero of the 27-24 win over the Chargers? Jaylen Watson , of course. The seventh-round pick stepped in front of a pass from Justin Herbert for the game-turning pick-six in the fourth quarter. This game was about getting key contributions in unlikely places: In addition to Watson's INT, the Chiefs received scores from wide receiver Justin Watson and reserve running back Jerick McKinnon . After a summer of hype for the entire division, the Chiefs remain positioned as the clear kings of the West heading into Week 3."
2022,3,3,Philadelphia Eagles,2-0,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Eagles have hit the ground running. Nick Sirianni's team dominated on both sides of the ball in a 24-7 win over the Vikings at raucous Lincoln Financial Field. Jalen Hurts again looked the part of a star on the rise, throwing for 333 yards while accounting for three total touchdowns. The star of the other side of the ball was cornerback Darius Slay , who will continue to intercept passes in Kirk Cousins ' nightmares for the next several evenings. The Eagles are a team without an obvious weakness right now -- and upcoming matchups against the Commanders and Jaguars provide a recipe for more good times."
2022,3,4,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2-0,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Ghost of Jameis Winston Past reemerged at just the right time for the Bucs, who picked off their former quarterback on three consecutive possessions -- including a Mike Edwards pick-six -- in a 20-10 win over the Saints at the Superdome. ""When Jameis left our team, everybody knows what he did that last year. ... He threw 30 picks,"" linebacker Devin White told FOX . ""We just knew he was going to give us the ball."" The defense carried the Bucs on a day in which the offense played without Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee) and was forced to finish the win without Mike Evans , who was ejected for his role in a bench-clearing brawl in the fourth quarter. On Monday, the league announced a one-game suspension for the emotional playmaker ."
2022,3,5,Green Bay Packers,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 8 Aaron Rodgers still owns the Bears, and Matt LaFleur is still undefeated (10-0) coming off a loss as Packers head coach. Rodgers shook off the disappointments of Week 1 with an efficient performance against Chicago that included two touchdown passes and just six incompletions in 25 attempts. The ever-underrated Aaron Jones was close to unstoppable (8.8 yards per carry), and the defense stepped up with a goal-line stand against Justin Fields that short-circuited an attempt by the Bears to add some drama into this one-sided rivalry. The Packers need to clean up some things (they're up to four fumbles in two weeks), but this is not a team to worry about."
2022,3,6,Los Angeles Rams,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 Jalen Ramsey : He's got that dog in him. The superstar cornerback high-pointed a Marcus Mariota heave to the end zone in the final minutes on Sunday, snagging the interception that sealed a too-close-for-comfort 31-27 win over the frisky Falcons at SoFi. Los Angeles opened up a 28-3 lead over Atlanta in the third quarter before some complacent play, coupled with a massive special teams gaffe , opened the door for the potential of a stunning upset. Ramsey slammed that door shut, but the Rams need to be sharper after an uninspiring first two weeks of their title defense."
2022,3,7,Los Angeles Chargers,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Chargers showed once again they have the talent to hang with any team in football. But getting over the hump? To graduate from good team to conference superpower? They're not there yet. An opportunity for an Arrowhead upset disappeared when Jaylen Watson stepped in front of a Justin Herbert pass in the fourth quarter and took it 99 yards the other way for the decisive score. It was a painful Thursday night for the Bolts quarterback in more ways than one: Herbert gutted through the game's waning minutes with an injury later diagnosed as a rib cartilage tear. Yes, he threw a post-injury laser to convert a fourth down and eventually added a TD pass , but Brandon Staley leaving the most important figure in the organization on the field in that state was still not a great look."

Tua Tagovailoa put up an historic performance on Sunday in Baltimore, throwing for 469 yards and six touchdowns in an epic comeback victory over the Ravens . Tua was unconscious in the game's fourth quarter, throwing four of his scores in the final period, including the game-winner to Jaylen Waddle with less than a minute to play. This was the proof-of-concept game for first-year coach Mike McDaniel, who has an offense that can deliver in a shootout. Tua will need to stack quality games to prove he's the guy, but this was nothing less than a clarion call to the believers."
2022,3,9,San Francisco 49ers,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The decision to not trade Jimmy Garoppolo just saved the 49ers' season. Trey Lance 's second pro campaign is over after he suffered a broken ankle in Sunday's win over the Seahawks, a stunning turn of events that returns Jimmy G to the starting role he lost to Lance in the offseason. Garoppolo is a pro, and he showed it by taking over without notice on Sunday and leading the offense with a steady hand for the final three quarters. In other words, it was your typical Garoppolo performance. He has less upside than Lance (the theoretical idea of Lance, anyway), but he gives you a safer baseline. For a Super Bowl-ready team like the Niners, he might actually work out better than a healthy Lance would have."

Instead, the story out of Baltimore centers on the total collapse of Mike Macdonald's defense in a stunning 42-38 loss to the Dolphins. Jackson's 79-yard touchdown run put the Ravens ahead 35-14 late in the third quarter, but Baltimore surrendered touchdown drives of 75, 59, 64 and 68 yards in the final 15 minutes, watching helplessly as Tua Tagovailoa morphed into a southpaw version of peak Dan Marino. ""Never did you think we were going to have that many balls thrown over our head,"" John Harbaugh said of his undermanned secondary. ""That just can't happen. That's not OK. I don't care who's back there."""
2022,3,11,Minnesota Vikings,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Eight days after an impressive season-opening win over the Packers , the Vikings went to Philadelphia and got humbled by an Eagles team that was superior in every facet of the game. Minnesota's defensive game plan almost seemed tailored to make Jalen Hurts as comfortable as possible, while Kirk Cousins labored through yet another disastrous prime-time performance. Cousins was pressured constantly and routinely threw the ball up for grabs, resulting in three interceptions. Even Justin Jefferson had a rough night: The prodigious young wideout was held to just 48 yards and was largely erased when covered by Darius Slay , who had two picks while in Jefferson's orbit. An ugly night all around."
2022,3,12,Cincinnati Bengals,0-2,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals continue to scuffle on offense -- an issue you can trace back to January. The primary culprit remains the offensive line, which has four new starters but continues to let down Joe Burrow , who was sacked six times in a 20-17 loss to the Cowboys. Despite the struggles up front, Burrow led a fourth-quarter comeback that pulled Cincinnati even, and after a Dallas punt, the Bengals were set up with the ball and 2:13 remaining on the clock. This was the Bengals' moment -- but like we saw against the Steelers in Week 1 , they let it slip away. Cincy went three-and-out, allowing Dallas to take over and march to the game-winning field goal . There's something off in The Queen City."

Here's what concerns us: Everything else. Jameis Winston threw interceptions on three consecutive second-half possessions that led to 17 Bucs points in a 20-10 loss at Caesars Superdome. Winston, reportedly dealing with four fractures in his back, struggled with his accuracy and looked tentative in a performance that should cause Dennis Allen to think about whether it's wise for his quarterback to play hurt . The news was better for the defense, which shut down the Bucs' attack for most of the afternoon. Would Tom Brady have completed the go-ahead touchdown pass in the fourth quarter if New Orleans corner Marshon Lattimore hadn't been ejected for fighting with Mike Evans ? We'll never know."

Before Byron Murphy Jr. 's scoop-and-score in overtime, it was Kyler Murray who willed the Cardinals back from the brink with his signature style of greatness. Murray kept plays alive with his legs and made several money throws with his arm, none bigger than the 2-point conversion dart to A.J. Green with no time remaining in regulation. On defense, it was former first-round pick Isiah Simmons , who, after seeing his playing time reduced following a rough Week 1, came up huge with the forced fumble in overtime that led to the win. ""He can be as good as he wants,"" Kliff Kingsbury said of Simmons. ""It's commitment to football, all day, every day. We've seen the flashes."""

Up 20-0 after two quarters against Arizona, Las Vegas managed just 48 yards of offense in the second half as Kyler Murray worked his magic to push the game into overtime. The extra period brought more Raiders struggles: Derek Carr nearly threw an interception, and Hunter Renfrow fumbled twice , the second being scooped up by cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. and taken to the house for a stunning Cardinals victory . The summer featured much talk about the connection between Carr and Davante Adams . On Sunday, the quarterback and All-Pro wideout connected two times for 12 yards and a 1-yard touchdown . The Raiders need a road win against the Titans to avoid the dreaded 0-3 start."
2022,3,16,Detroit Lions,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Are the Detroit Lions an offensive juggernaut? Maybe! Dan Campbell's Grit Warriors found little resistance from the visiting Commanders in a 36-27 win at celebratory Ford Field, becoming the first Lions team since 1970 to score 35-plus in their first two games of the season. Jared Goff threw four touchdown passes on Sunday, and he's getting plenty of help: Amon-Ra St. Brown (184 total yards, two touchdowns) is developing into a legit No. 1 wideout, while D'Andre Swift (87 total yards and a TD on just seven touches) looks like a running back prepping his application for The Superstar Club . Throw in a three-sack game for No. 2 overall pick Aidan Hutchinson , and the feel-good Lions could be transitioning into the actually -good Lions. Behold the metamorphosis!"

The Russell Wilson -led Broncos did the bare minimum on Sunday, squeaking by a bad Texans team despite an avalanche of penalties, more disturbing clock-management issues and continued red-zone incompetence. How bad did it get on Sunday? In the second half, fans at Mile High were counting down the play clock in unison in an effort to help (OK, mock ) new head coach Nathaniel Hackett. The Broncos look disorganized and out of sorts thus far -- they are extremely fortunate to escape the season's first two weeks with a win. Hackett has to get this thing calmed down before the natives revolt."

It's proof of progress for the Belichicks, who managed two more scores (one greatly aided by a Steelers special teams gaffe ) in a 17-14 win over the similarly offensively challenged Steelers at the Stadium Formerly Known As Heinz Field. Bonus points to an offensive line that bullied Pittsburgh's front in the game's final minutes and allowed the Pats to run out the clock on their first win. ""We're building an identity,"" said defensive back Devin McCourty . ""To come to Pittsburgh and gut out a win, you start to build who you are."""

Big Blue is 2-0 for the first time since 2016, and it's Don ""Wink"" Martindale's side of the ball that deserves most of the credit. The Giants' defense -- identified as a talent-poor liability entering the season -- has allowed just 36 points through two games. On Sunday , Martindale cooked up a scheme that flummoxed Baker Mayfield , who managed just 145 yards passing on 29 attempts. New York shut down the Carolina attack on a day in which Leonard Williams exited with an MCL sprain and first-round pick Kayvon Thibodeaux remained sidelined by a knee injury. The defense has another soft-schedule matchup on Monday against the Dak Prescott-free Cowboys ."
2022,3,20,Tennessee Titans,0-2,"Previous rank: No. 17 A ""bury the ball"" game in Buffalo. The Titans had their doors blown off by the host Bills on Monday Night Football , a 41-7 roasting that could have been a lot worse had Sean McDermott not called off the dogs after three quarters. Ryan Tannehill threw two interceptions (including the game-icing pick-six ) and Derrick Henry was held to 1.9 yards per carry on 13 rushes. The defense was completely mystified by Josh Allen , who threw four touchdowns and generally did whatever he wanted. In January, the Titans entered the postseason as the AFC's No. 1 seed. In September, they're winless and looking for answers."

But America's Team showed fight on Sunday. They jumped out to an early lead against the defending AFC champion Bengals, held off a Joe Burrow-led comeback, then got a 50-yard field goal from Brett Maher at the gun to secure a 20-17 victory at Jerrah World. Cooper Rush made several big-time throws in his first start in place of Prescott, the biggest a 10-yard connection to CeeDee Lamb that put Dallas in field-goal position in the final minute. Lamb also received some much-needed help from fellow wideout Noah Brown , who had receptions on all five of his targets for 91 yards and a touchdown. If the Rush-led offense can stay this competent, a strong Dallas defense will keep this team afloat."
2022,3,22,Cleveland Browns,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ When Nick Chubb rumbled into the end zone for his second touchdown on Sunday ( take a knee, hoss! ), the Browns led the Jets by 13 points with less than two minutes to play. New York had zero timeouts, and Cleveland had a 99.7 percent win probability. But 99.7 is not 100. A missed Cade York PAT was followed by a long Joe Flacco touchdown pass , a Jets onside kick recovery , another Flacco scoring toss and, finally, a Jacoby Brissett interception that sealed a 31-30 Browns loss , one of the worst in team history. ""This league is funny,"" Brissett said after the stunning collapse. ""This one was tough. It just shows you can't take anything in this league for granted."" Indeed."

Pittsburgh's offense was held under 300 yards for the second consecutive week, and a Gunner Olszewski special teams miscue proved to be the difference in a 17-14 loss to the Patriots. Olszewski's muffed punt set the Patriots up deep in Steelers territory and led to the decisive touchdown . It's the type of mistake this Pittsburgh team -- with Mitch Trubisky at quarterback and T.J. Watt on injured reserve -- cannot overcome. Kenny Pickett : Your time is near, young man."

The offense was held scoreless by the 49ers, and the defense couldn't get enough stops to keep things competitive in a 27-7 loss at Levi's Stadium. The game featured little in the way of positives, aside from a tremendous special teams play -- the blocked field-goal try returned for a touchdown by Mike Jackson -- that briefly gave Seattle life in the second half. That was it, however: The running game couldn't get going, DeeJay Dallas was the focal point of a trick play that should never be spoken of again, and Geno Smith hasn't led the offense to a point since the second quarter of the opener.

That's what countless Jets fans were thinking as they watched their eternally star-crossed team wipe away a 13-point deficit in the final 1:55 to stun the Browns, 31-30 , in Cleveland. It was a huge day for Joe Flacco , who threw four touchdown passes, including the game-clincher to breakout rookie Garrett Wilson , but none of it would have been possible if not for the special teams. Brant Boyer's unit had a fake-punt conversion to set up New York's first touchdown, Greg Zuerlein booted a 57-yard field goal in the fourth quarter and Braden Mann executed a perfect onside kick to set up the winning score. A miracle victory like this can have a galvanizing effect for a franchise that's spent years in the wilderness -- let's see if the momentum carries into Sunday's matchup against a desperate Bengals team."
2022,3,26,Indianapolis Colts,0-1-1,"Previous rank: No. 15 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Are the Colts a bad team? It's fair to wonder after Sunday's listless 24-0 loss to the Jaguars. Indy was well set up to gain a measure of revenge after last season's catastrophic Week 18 loss to the Jags , but the Colts instead appeared more lost than they ever were with Carson Wentz at the controls. Matt Ryan has done nothing to elevate this offense in two weeks, and he's not getting much help from an underperforming offensive line and a thin wide receiver group that was without Michael Pittman Jr. The soft nature of the AFC South should provide some runaway to get things sorted out, but a tie with the Texans and non-competitive loss to the Jaguars is as ominous as it gets."
2022,3,27,Washington Commanders,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 24 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Carson Wentz did his part after a quiet first half, but the Commanders won't win many games by asking their quarterback to be a do-everything savior. Wentz got very little support from the running game (anemic for two weeks running), but the real culprit in Sunday's loss to Detroit was a defense that allowed a relaxed Jared Goff to throw four touchdown passes without a pick and the Lions' running game to rumble for 191 yards. Wentz and the offense did their best to make things interesting after the Commanders fell behind 22-0 at halftime, but the defense proved incapable of getting a big stop to shift the game's momentum. Get well soon , Chase Young ."
2022,3,28,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 Now that's the version of Trevor Lawrence the Jaguars are looking for. Last year's No. 1 overall pick played smart and efficient football in his second start of the season, avoiding the mistakes of last week's loss in Washington and letting the Jacksonville defense do the rest in a 24-0 win over the sagging Colts. Lawrence had completions to seven different receivers, including two passing scores to Christian Kirk . Credit Doug Pederson for cooking up a sound game plan that gave Lawrence good looks and open receivers as Jacksonville built up a 17-0 lead at the half. Embarrassing a supposedly superior division rival should be all the evidence the Jags need that the AFC South is there for the taking."
2022,3,29,Atlanta Falcons,0-2,"Previous rank: No. 30 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Falcons nearly exorcised some franchise demons in Los Angeles . Arthur Smith's team fell behind the Rams 28-3 before mounting a furious rally that put Atlanta on the doorstep of a stunning upset on a Sunday filled with them. Unfortunately, Marcus Mariota 's bid to put the Falcons ahead in the final minute was foiled by Jalen Ramsey , who made an acrobatic interception to end it. Still, there were positives to take out of the day: Drake London had his first touchdown , Darren Hall forced a Cooper Kupp fumble and Lorenzo Carter recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown . This is a better Atlanta team than we saw a year ago ... now the Falcons just need to find a path to victory."
2022,3,30,Chicago Bears,1-1,"Previous rank: No. 25 Justin Fields nearly made it a game with his doomed fourth-and-goal stretch on Sunday night, but when the dust settled on a 27-7 loss , it was clear the dynamic of the Packers-Bears ""rivalry"" remains unchanged. Chicago was outclassed, particularly on defense in the run game. The Packers piled up 203 rushing yards, with Aaron Jones averaging nearly 9.0 yards per attempt. David Montgomery delivered a stellar statistical performance of his own, but what's up with the Bears' passing game? Fields had just 11 pass attempts all night, while nominal No. 1 wideout Darnell Mooney has 4 yards through two games. This team will need more monsoons to make a playoff push."
2022,3,31,Carolina Panthers,0-2,"Previous rank: No. 29 If the Panthers offense we've seen in the first two weeks is what we'll get for the entire season, a lot of changes are coming to Charlotte -- and perhaps sooner than you think. Baker Mayfield has not proved himself to be a solution at quarterback thus far, leaving the door open for a potential Sam Darnold lineup return once he's healthy . The Carolina defense has done its part, keeping mediocre Browns and Giants offenses from going wild, but the Panthers have now lost nine straight games dating back to last season. Matt Rhule's seat is hot."
2022,3,32,Houston Texans,0-1-1,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ It's not too early to have serious concerns about the Texans' offense. A week after Davis Mills and Co. disappeared in the fourth quarter and overtime against the Colts, Houston managed just 234 yards and three field goals in a 16-9 loss to the Broncos at Mile High. Mills also fumbled twice and averaged less than 5.0 yards per attempt in an uninspiring effort that included a four-and-out in the final minute. A bright spot for Houston? The defense, which repeatedly turned Denver away in the red zone and held Russell Wilson to just one touchdown pass. The Broncos were sloppy and begging to be picked off ... but the Texans weren't up for the challenge."
2022,4,1,Philadelphia Eagles,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Philadelphia's a big green wrecking machine right now. Jalen Hurts and the Eagles' offense have been showing out since the season opener in Detroit, but now Nick Sirianni's defense has announced its arrival with a dominant nine-sack performance against the Commanders and old friend Carson Wentz . What's the most pressing ""problem"" for the undefeated Iggles? DeVonta Smith was so dominant on Sunday (156 yards in the first half alone), it calls into question whether A.J. Brown is the team's true No. 1 receiver. ""By the eyes, he might be a little slight, but he plays like a big boy ,"" Hurts said of Smith. ""He's a guy, when his number's called, I know he'll answer the phone."""
2022,4,2,Buffalo Bills,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bills ran 51 more plays than the Dolphins and still got beat -- if you were offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey, you'd probably lose your religion, too . Frustrations from an unusual game aside, the biggest concern in Buffalo is an injury-ravaged defense that was without five starters in Miami. The secondary has been particularly besieged: Star safety Micah Hyde is out for the year with a neck injury, while safety Jordan Poyer (foot) and cornerbacks Dane Jackson (neck) and Christian Benford (who suffered a fractured hand against Miami) have all been sidelined. On Sunday, the Dolphins were able to exploit the Bills' untested backups with some big downfield strikes; it's a trend that will continue as long as Buffalo is undermanned."
2022,4,3,Miami Dolphins,3-0,"Previous rank: No. 8 The Dolphins enter Week 4 alone atop the AFC East after a stranger-than-fiction 21-19 win over the powerhouse Bills. Miami's offense possessed the ball for just under 20 minutes against Buffalo, but the quick-strike attack made the most of its limited opportunities. The biggest play of the game came on a third-and-22 in the fourth quarter, as Jaylen Waddle split the Bills' secondary for a 45-yard gain that set up the go-ahead score. Throw in a survived Butt Punt and some clock-management and special teams failures by a previously impervious opponent, and you can say the Dolphins are living a charmed life right now."
2022,4,4,Green Bay Packers,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 Gossip item: Aaron Rodgers might be finding new love in his wideout room. Rookie fourth-rounder Romeo Doubs hauled in all eight of his targets for 73 yards and a score in a narrow win over the Bucs. If Doubs gains Rodgers' trust, he can become a breakout star overnight. Meanwhile, is Rodgers finally getting his blind-side protector back? David Bakhtiari made another attempt at a return to the Packers lineup, playing 35 offensive snaps in a rotation with Yosh Nijman on Sunday. Bakhtiari was one of the best left tackles in football before suffering a knee injury in practice on Dec. 31, 2020. A return to form would be a massive lift for the entire offense."
2022,4,5,Kansas City Chiefs,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Chiefs are going to want that one back. Kansas City didn't feel like the inferior team in a road matchup against the Colts, but an avalanche of critical mistakes opened the door for the 20-17 upset . Skyy Moore muffed a punt to set up Indy's first touchdown, while Harrison Butker fill-in Matt Ammendola missed a 34-yard field-goal try and an extra point. By the time Patrick Mahomes threw his lone interception in the final seconds, the Chiefs had already made enough errors to deserve their fate. Expect to see a much cleaner version of Andy Reid's team on Sunday night against the Bucs ."
2022,4,6,Los Angeles Rams,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 6 While the Rams' offense continues to work out the kinks, Sean McVay's defense has been tasked with keeping the team on a winning track. They did their job on Sunday in Arizona, holding Kyler Murray and the Cardinals without a touchdown in a 20-12 win . The Cardinals punted on their first four possessions and settled for four field goals as the Rams took control behind touchdowns from Cooper Kupp and Cam Akers . ""There are no style points in this game,"" McVay said . ""But there are ways to play more complete games. That's what we're hunting."""
2022,4,7,Baltimore Ravens,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 10 In Week 3, the Ravens' defense collapsed in the fourth quarter against the Dolphins. On Sunday at Foxborough, Baltimore's defense closed its opponent out. The Ravens produced three turnovers in the fourth quarter, including a crucial end-zone interception by Marlon Humphrey , to help seal a 37-26 win over the Patriots. Lamar Jackson continued to look like the NFL's early front-runner for MVP, producing five total touchdowns . ""No one has to tell me about Lamar Jackson,"" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said of his QB (and pending free agent ). ""I believed in him from the first day we drafted him."""
2022,4,8,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Tom Brady needs his friends back on the playground. On Sunday, the G.O.A.T. once again played without wide receivers Mike Evans ( suspension ), Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee), as well as left tackle Donovan Smith (elbow), in a 14-12 loss to the Packers. Chalk it up to bad timing for a key conference showdown that could have significant ramifications come playoff-seeding time. With the Chiefs on deck , the challenges keep coming in different forms: The Bucs moved operations to Miami this week in order to practice out of the path of Hurricane Ian. The storm is projected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida in the coming days."
2022,4,9,Minnesota Vikings,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 11 Kirk Cousins and the Vikings looked outclassed against the Eagles in the second game of Week 2's Monday doubleheader. Early on against the Lions on Sunday, it looked like more of the same. But Minnesota and its QB showed resolve, digging out of 14-0 and 24-14 holes to beat an NFC North rival and get things back on track after that humbling prime-time loss. The hero was K.J. Osborn , who zipped through the Detroit defense almost unnoticed for the go-ahead 28-yard touchdown with 45 seconds to play. Osborn has found his niche in this offense -- since the start of last season, no Vikings receiver has more catches in two-minute situations than the 2020 fifth-round pick."
2022,4,10,Cincinnati Bengals,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 Cincinnati finally looked the part of a defending conference champion on Sunday, setting the tone with two first-quarter touchdown drives en route to a 27-12 win over the Jets at the Meadowlands. Joe Burrow threw three touchdown passes and was the beneficiary of quality pass protection from an offensive line that struggled mightily in the first two weeks. The Bengals still need to figure out what is wrong with their running game after logging 69 rushing yards, but Sunday was a positive first step after an early stumble. ""We just needed to get the first win,"" coach Zac Taylor said. ""I didn't really care what it looked like. I didn't care if it was 3-0 or 49-3. We just needed to rip that Band-Aid off, get that first win. We've been a confident team all along."""
2022,4,11,San Francisco 49ers,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 9 The 49ers are very fortunate to have Jimmy Garoppolo on the team after quarterback Trey Lance 's season-ending injury ... it just didn't feel that way following Sunday night's 11-10 loss to the Broncos. Garoppolo struggled to move the offense throughout the evening, reminding the football world why Kyle Shanahan and the rest of the Niners braintrust pivoted to Lance in the first place. Garoppolo followed Denver's lone touchdown drive in the fourth quarter with an ugly interception , and he even went Full Orlovsky for a safety in a game decided by one point. San Francisco's defense will keep the team in most contests, but the 49ers will need more from the other side of the ball."
2022,4,12,Tennessee Titans,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 20 It's amazing how different the Titans look when Derrick Henry is seeming like himself. Tennessee's star running back was bottled up in the first two weeks but broke out in a much-needed 24-22 win over the Raiders in Nashville. Henry finished with 143 total yards and a score, running through would-be tacklers like peak King Henry. According to ESPN , Henry gained 65 yards after contact -- the Titans are 19-3 when Henry crosses the 60 threshold in that category. Henry's success makes other aspects of the Titans' offense go."
2022,4,13,Dallas Cowboys,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Cowboys are winning games, and Cooper Rush has been a major reason why. The backup quarterback, inserted into the starting lineup after Dak Prescott 's Week 1 thumb injury , has done excellent work in back-to-back wins over the Bengals and Giants . Rush was at his best down the stretch on Monday night, completing 12 of 13 passes on consecutive drives in the second half. The go-ahead touchdown, a perfect dart of a corner end-zone strike to CeeDee Lamb , couldn't have been thrown better by Dak himself. Not bad for a guy who was cut at the end of training camp and left unclaimed by 31 other teams."
2022,4,14,Denver Broncos,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 17 If the Broncos find their groove and end up making noise in the AFC this year, they'll look back and marvel at how fortunate they were to escape the season's first three weeks with a winning record. With the Denver offense again unimpressive on Sunday night against the 49ers, the defense continued to carry the team -- forcing two turnovers in the final 2:06 to clinch a bizarre-as-its-score 11-10 win . Expect to hear plenty of talk out of Denver this week about the go-ahead fourth-quarter touchdown drive piloted by Russell Wilson and the potentially galvanizing effect it can have on the attack going forward. We'll see about that."
2022,4,15,Los Angeles Chargers,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 7 Things have gotten very ugly, very quickly for the Chargers. A 38-10 blowout loss to the upstart Jaguars was just the beginning of Los Angeles' problems. The team entered Sunday without wide receiver Keenan Allen (hamstring), cornerback J.C. Jackson (ankle) or center Corey Linsley (knee), then lost left tackle Rashawn Slater (biceps) and wide receiver Jalen Guyton (knee) to season-ending injuries, while pass rusher Joey Bosa suffered a significant groin injury . Given Justin Herbert 's vulnerable physical state following his Week 2 rib injury, the absence of a young star blind-side protector like Slater could have a catastrophic effect on the team's hopes. The Bolts cannot catch a break."
2022,4,16,Detroit Lions,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 16 Dan Campbell owned it. Facing a fourth-and-4 in Vikings territory with a chance to ice a huge road win by securing one more first down, the Lions coach shifted away from his aggressive strategy and sent out the kicker. One miss and a busted coverage later, and Minnesota had stolen a 28-24 win from Detroit. ""I regret that decision 100 percent,"" Campbell said. ""I really do. I hate it. I feel like I cost our team. I really do, man."" The strange thing? Campbell repeatedly left his offense on the field in similar situations earlier on Sunday, converting first downs on four of six fourth-down tries. The coach got cold feet at the wrong time."
2022,4,17,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 22 Three weeks in, and Nick Chubb has a damn good case for the title of Best Running Back On The Planet . The Browns star was again a dominant force on Thursday Night Football against the Steelers, rolling to 113 yards and a touchdown in a 29-17 win . It was Chubb's third straight game over 100 yards from scrimmage to begin the year. The victory represented a huge lift for Cleveland after the team's baffling Week 2 collapse against the Jets. Chubb's ability to run through tackles and keep defenses off balance has been a prime factor in Jacoby Brissett 's surprisingly strong start behind center. The Browns' offense has been balanced and efficient."
2022,4,18,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 28 Isn't it strange how James Robinson couldn't seem to find his way out of Urban Meyer's doghouse last year, and now he's one of the AFC's most explosive running backs ? It's another example of the post-Meyer night-and-day vibes around the Jaguars, who have put together the best three-week performance in the AFC South -- by far! -- to start the season. Meanwhile, Trevor Lawrence threw three more touchdown passes and seems like a talented young quarterback ready to make the leap. After a beatdown of the Chargers in L.A., the Jags have the feel of a legitimate playoff contender in their muddled conference . That Doug Pederson guy must know what he's doing."
2022,4,19,New Orleans Saints,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Saints are headed to London for a matchup against the Vikings that could have playoff implications down the line. Should Jameis Winston be the quarterback for that game? Winston has not looked like the same player since Week 1, after which he began showing up on the injury report with a back injury. The veteran threw two more interceptions in Sunday's loss to the Panthers, and he made other throws into traffic that had favorable (read: lucky) outcomes. Andy Dalton remains one of the better backup quarterbacks in the league -- it's fair to wonder if we could see him relieve Winston on Sunday if the offense remains rudderless."
2022,4,20,Arizona Cardinals,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ As the weeks go by, it's becoming increasingly apparent the Cardinals' offense is exclusively reliant on Kyler Murray going off script to create magic. When that doesn't happen -- and we haven't seen it, aside from the second-half explosion against the Raiders in Week 2 -- Arizona is stuck in mud. Sunday was an odd one: The Cardinals ran 35 more plays than the Rams but had just 26 more total yards of offense in a 20-12 loss . Arizona badly misses suspended receiver DeAndre Hopkins , but Nuk alone won't be able to fix this attack. Kliff Kingsbury has his work cut out for him."
2022,4,21,Las Vegas Raiders,0-3,"Previous rank: No. 15 This is not the start Josh McDaniels was looking for in his second chance as a head coach. The Raiders dropped to 0-3 after another narrow loss, this time to the Titans , and McDaniels' postgame media availability was reportedly preceded by a closed-door meeting with Raiders owner Mark Davis. The history here is not good. Since 2000, only one team that started 0-3 rebounded to make the playoffs (the 2018 Texans). Still, these Raiders have a chance: They play in an AFC West that is far softer than we anticipated, and they've had the chance to win or tie on the final possession of each loss so far. The Raiders might be winless, but they aren't hopeless."
2022,4,22,New York Giants,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 19 Daniel Jones is a tough dude at quarterback, but the punishment the fourth-year starter absorbs on a routine basis is unsustainable. The Cowboys were all over Jones on Monday night, piling up five sacks and 23 pressures in a 23-16 loss at the Meadowlands. The 23 pressures were the most Jones has faced in 40 career starts and the most faced by any quarterback in a game this season, according to ESPN . ""Boy, short week for him,"" remarked ESPN's Troy Aikman after another Jones takedown in the fourth quarter. ""He's going to be in an ice bath all week."""
2022,4,23,Indianapolis Colts,1-1-1,"Previous rank: No. 26 There are still multiple areas in which the Colts must improve, but the big picture coming out of Week 3 was very pleasant: Indy knocked off Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in a win that Frank Reich's team desperately needed following a wretched start to the season. The defense deserves major credit for keeping Mahomes in check, culminating in Rodney McLeod 's game-sealing interception in the final seconds. Matt Ryan 's stat line tells the story of progress, but the veteran was sacked five more times, fumbling twice behind a surprisingly leaky offensive line. The 37-year-old Ryan is a statue at this stage -- this entire experiment always hinged on a major protection upgrade for the former MVP, who was sacked 40-plus times in each of his final four seasons in Atlanta. He's received the opposite of that."
2022,4,24,New England Patriots,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 18 The offense showed legitimate signs of life on Sunday against the Ravens, but the Patriots won't survive if they can't protect the football. Bill Belichick's team turned the ball over four times, with three of those coming on Mac Jones interceptions, in a 37-26 loss to Baltimore. A frustrating afternoon came to an ugly conclusion: Jones had to be helped to the locker room after being injured on his final play of the game. On Monday, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported that Jones suffered a "" pretty severe "" high ankle sprain that leaves his availability unclear moving forward. Swapping out Jones for Brian Hoyer for any length of time is just about the last thing this team needs."
2022,4,25,Atlanta Falcons,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 29 The Falcons have weapons. Legitimate weapons. Drake London has hit the ground running as an impact No. 1 wide receiver in his rookie season, and second-year tight end Kyle Pitts continues to display elite playmaker traits when given the chance. But the glue of the Atlanta operation remains Cordarrelle Patterson . The veteran ran over a bad Seahawks defense on Sunday, piling up 141 yards and a touchdown on the ground in a 27-23 win . It's Patterson's second 100-yard effort in three weeks and more proof that Arthur Smith is the guy who finally found a way to make Patterson a true star beyond special teams. Quite a feather in the hat for the coach."
2022,4,26,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 23 It's not that Mitch Trubisky was bad on Thursday Night Football against the Browns . He really wasn't. It's just that the veteran's ceiling is so low that it turns the Steelers' offense into a sports car trying to win a race with a restrictor plate affixed to the engine. That's a problem, because the Pittsburgh defense isn't a difference-maker without T.J. Watt 's enormous presence. Trubisky's ceiling and the torn pectoral that will keep Watt out for several more weeks is a bad combo that leaves a razor-thin margin for error every week for Mike Tomlin's team."
2022,4,27,Chicago Bears,2-1,"Previous rank: No. 30 Eyebrows raised when Justin Fields came out of Chicago's first two games with just 28 total pass attempts. You have a better idea of any trepidation Matt Eberflus may have after watching the second-year passer stumble through Sunday's win over the Texans. Fields threw two interceptions , fumbled twice and generally looked uncomfortable piloting the Chicago attack. We knew this was going to be a season of growing pains for Fields and the Bears -- but the early signs suggest those pains might be more severe than expected."
2022,4,28,Seattle Seahawks,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 24 Geno Smith evacuated the pocket, scrambled to his right, kept his eyes upfield and unfurled a tight spiral. It looked like the setup for a special moment for the Seahawks, but there would be no fairytale ending. Smith's pass was intercepted by Falcons safety Richie Grant , who slid to the turf to clinch a win for the Falcons . Smith has been about average in his three games as starter this season, but it's the defense that presents the biggest issue for Pete Carroll. Seattle gave up scores on five of Atlanta's first seven possessions, a worrying sign for a team that talked a lot about a new-and-improved scheme entering the year. Instead, it's been more of the same."
2022,4,29,Carolina Panthers,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 31 The Panthers continue to get little from Baker Mayfield and the offense. Luckily, the defense was ready to step up against the Saints. Marquis Haynes set the tone with a scoop-and-score fumble recovery TD in the first quarter, and two second-half interceptions of Jameis Winston helped to seal a much-needed 22-14 win that snapped a nine-game losing streak dating back to last season. Afterward, Panthers players presented coach Matt Rhule with the game ball . ""I want the game to always be about the players,"" Rhule said. ""With that being said, it was a tremendous honor. But at the end of the day, it's not about me. I want them to make me right."""
2022,4,30,Washington Commanders,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 27 Sunday was a measuring-stick game for the Commanders, who came up short in pretty much every way possible. The Eagles got an eye-opening breakout performance by DeVonta Smith to build a 24-0 lead over Washington, then unleashed their pass rush on poor Carson Wentz , who was sacked nine times in a 24-8 loss . Wentz is the type of quarterback who can act spooked when his protection isn't right, and the Commanders' offensive line is not nearly good enough right now to get this attack to a consistent, proficient level."
2022,4,31,New York Jets,1-2,"Previous rank: No. 25 New York has held a lead for 22 seconds this season. Luckily it was the final 22 seconds of a miracle win in Cleveland. Otherwise, it's been an ominous start to 2022 for the perpetually rebuilding Jets. Joe Flacco struggled mightily in Sunday's 27-12 loss to the Bengals, missing open receivers and showing a remarkable inability to protect the football when hit in the pocket. The defense is also an issue: The pass rush hasn't been as good as advertised, while the secondary continues to give up big plays, thanks to weekly miscommunications . Zach Wilson appears set to make his season debut against the Steelers on Sunday , but the young QB can't fix everything."
2022,4,32,Houston Texans,0-2-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans desperately need to find a way to improve their run defense. The Bears rushed for 281 yards on Sunday , averaging 7.0 yards per carry in a game despite their standout running back, David Montgomery , missing the bulk of the afternoon with a knee/ankle injury. Houston's continued issues on the ground stood in stark contrast to the team's success in the passing game. Chicago QB Justin Fields was harassed into two picks and two fumbles and generally did nothing. Still, it wasn't enough. ""We've lost three winnable games,"" coach Lovie Smith said. ""Glass half-full, that's saying that we're close."""
2022,5,1,Philadelphia Eagles,4-0,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Adversity came for the Eagles on Sunday, and they turned it away . Playing in rainy conditions and with multiple important players forced out of action with injuries, Philly relied on its ground attack (210 yards rushing) and an opportunistic defense (five turnovers) to hold off a game Jaguars team at the Linc. Quarterback Jalen Hurts looked pedestrian for the first time all season, so Miles Sanders did the heavy lifting, with 134 yards and two scores on 27 carries. The NFL's lone undefeated team, the Eagles should have another favorable matchup this Sunday against the inconsistent Cardinals."
2022,5,2,Buffalo Bills,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bills were getting pushed around by the Ravens during what had the makings of a classic Statement Game for John Harbaugh's lot, a blowout conquest that would change the perception of two superpowers. Then, in a manner few teams in the league can even approach, Buffalo flipped a switch. After spotting the Ravens an early 17-point lead, the Bills reeled off the final 20 points of a 23-20 win in Baltimore. Josh Allen , per usual, was the engine on offense, but Jordan Poyer was the star of this day: The safety had two interceptions, including the end-zone pick of Lamar Jackson that kept the score tied and set up Buffalo's march to the game-winning field goal as time expired. Championship mettle by the team from Western New York."
2022,5,3,Kansas City Chiefs,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 5 Patrick Mahomes used the prime-time stage of Sunday Night Football to remind the world that he remains -- even in a golden age of quarterback play -- a one-of-one proposition. The Chiefs superstar was unstoppable in a 41-31 win over the Bucs, gleefully shredding Todd Bowles' well-regarded defense. The highlight that will play one day during his Canton-induction sizzle reel? The scramble and acrobatic flip to Clyde Edwards-Helaire for an absurd touchdown in the second quarter. ""The NFL hasn't seen anything like Mahomes -- I promise you that,"" Travis Kelce said after the victory. ""You saw it today -- he's the Houdini of our era ."""
2022,5,4,Green Bay Packers,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 When it was over, FOX cameras captured Packers coach Matt LaFleur removing his headset with a look of epic relief etched across his face. A home affair against a lesser Patriots team playing its third-string, rookie quarterback should not have stretched to overtime, but Green Bay is a team fighting itself while still in possession of enough muscle memory to win in the process. ""This way of winning I don't think is sustainable because it puts too much pressure on our defense,"" Aaron Rodgers said . ""And obviously, I've got to play better and will play better."" Rodgers is far from the problem. In fact, the reigning MVP made several brilliant throws Sunday. He just needs more help from his collection of mostly unproven receivers."
2022,5,5,San Francisco 49ers,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Niners picked a nice moment to deliver their best performance of the year. San Francisco used the Monday Night Football spotlight to stick it to the defending champions. The 24-9 win over the Rams sends all four NFC West teams into Week 5 with identical 2-2 records. The Niners' defense sacked Matthew Stafford seven times, and breakout safety Talanoa Hufanga iced the game with a fourth-quarter pick-six . The Jimmy Garoppolo -led offense was in fine form, as well: Nearly three quarters of Garoppolo's 239 passing yards came after the catch. ""We're getting the YAC Bros back,"" Jimmy G said after the win. ""That's for sure."""
2022,5,6,Cincinnati Bengals,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 10 Bengals back? We think so! Joe Burrow passed for 287 yards and two scores, including the game-icing fourth-down TD flip to Hayden Hurst that sealed a 27-15 win over the previously undefeated Dolphins. After the victory, Burrow complimented his offensive line , a maligned unit that stepped up and kept Joey Franchise clean throughout the night (just one sack). Burrow's favorite target was -- once again -- a receiver other than Ja'Marr Chase : Tee Higgins went off for 124 yards and a touchdown on seven catches. It feels like the Bengals are back to beast status. We'll know for sure after Sunday night's showdown with the Ravens in Baltimore."
2022,5,7,Baltimore Ravens,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Ravens are clearly a dangerous team, but man, do they know how to lose. Baltimore built a 20-3 first-half advantage over the powerhouse Bills, only to watch it all slip away in a last-second loss that left John Harbaugh answering questions about a fourth-down gamble that went terribly awry. ""So, hindsight, you could take the points,"" Harbaugh said of the decision to bypass a go-ahead field goal and instead go for it on fourth down with just over four minutes remaining. ""But if you look at it analytically, you understand why we did it."" Understandable? Sure. But poor execution -- Lamar Jackson floated a pass into the end zone that was intercepted by Bills safety Jordan Poyer -- led to a defeat every bit as bitter as the fourth-quarter meltdown against the Dolphins in Week 2. Get this out of your system now, gang."
2022,5,8,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bucs got several important starters back in the lineup for Sunday night's showdown against the Chiefs, but Patrick Mahomes and his collection of playmakers are simply ahead of Tom Brady and his supporting cast at this point. The result: a 41-31 loss that never felt particularly competitive. A disappointing setback, no doubt, but Tampa Bay got out of the teeth of its schedule in respectable shape, with a much softer slate of opponents ahead. Let the morning TV screamers honk about what's wrong with Brady and Co. -- we're pushing pause on any serious cause for concern."
2022,5,9,Minnesota Vikings,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 9 The Vikings responded to a humbling prime-time loss to the Eagles with back-to-back four- and three-point victories . This bodes well for a team that figures to play in plenty of close games this season. The biggest development in Sunday's win over the Saints in London was the return of Justin Jefferson as a prolific playmaker. After a pair of quiet outings, the third-year wideout scored untouched on a rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter, then had the 39-yard reception that set up Greg Joseph 's game-winner in the final minute of play. Jefferson is Kevin O'Connell's one true trump card: When he's on one, Minnesota can play with any team in the league."
2022,5,10,Miami Dolphins,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 The Dolphins lost for the first time this season against the Bengals on Thursday Night Football , but the story after the game surrounded Tua Tagovailoa , and the head and neck injuries that sent him to a Cincinnati-area medical center after a second-quarter sack. Tua was quickly released from the hospital and flew back to Miami with the team, but questions linger about whether the QB should have been on the field at all after his head was slammed to the turf in the Week 3 win over the Bills. The NFL Players Association terminated the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant involved in Tagovailoa's concussion check, and changes to the league's concussion protocol are being implemented . On Monday, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel ruled Tua out of Sunday's game against the Jets. Expect Miami to handle this situation with extreme caution moving forward."
2022,5,11,Los Angeles Rams,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 6 It's officially time to start worrying about the Rams. Facing a stout Niners defense in a loud road environment, the Matthew Stafford -led Los Angeles attack looked flat and punchless in a 24-9 loss that promises to be an impossible film watch for Sean McVay and friends. Stafford was sacked seven times, threw a game-ending pick-six and generally looks like a quarterback who doesn't have a lick of trust in anyone other than Cooper Kupp . In related news, the much-hyped addition of presumptive No. 2 receiver Allen Robinson (two catches, 7 yards on Monday) is fast approaching boondoggle territory. How's that knee feeling, Odell ?"
2022,5,12,Tennessee Titans,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 Sunday had to be a soothing day for the defending AFC South champions. Derrick Henry ran all over the rival Colts like in the good old days, and Tennessee pulled itself back to .500 with a 24-17 win over its longtime rival. Mike Vrabel's team is back on track, but issues linger -- most distressingly, the ones coming out of the halftime tunnel. The Titans have been strangely inept in the second half of the first four games, outscored by a whopping total of 64-7 in those contests. It didn't cost them against a struggling Colts offense on Sunday, but better opponents will storm through the door the Titans keep leaving open."
2022,5,13,Dallas Cowboys,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 It felt like the Cowboys were doomed when Dak Prescott went down with a Week 1 thumb injury that required surgery. Instead, Dallas finds itself riding a three-game win streak, thanks in large part to a defense that's been close to dominant. The Cowboys have given up a single touchdown in each of their four games, taking the pressure off Cooper Rush and allowing the backup QB to play in a controlled environment with a positive game script. Rush has taken that nice setup and run with it, building chemistry with CeeDee Lamb and immediately finding a connection with Michael Gallup -- playing in his first game since suffering a torn ACL in January -- in Sunday's win over the Commanders. There's no question this remains Dak's job, but there's no need to rush him back when you've got ... Rush."
2022,5,14,Los Angeles Chargers,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 15 Say hello to Jamaree Salyer . The Chargers have been besieged by injuries at multiple positions, and it's Salyer who might be the most important new figure amongst the cavalry of replacements. The sixth-round pick's first start in place of injured Pro Bowl left tackle Rashawn Slater went off without a hitch: Justin Herbert was kept mostly clean in a 34-24 win over the Texans. A match with a lowly opponent like Houston is a nice spot to get your feet wet, but the challenge will be far greater if Myles Garrett returns to the lineup for the Browns in Week 5 . For now, the Bolts will savor a small victory after the barrage of casualties that has threatened to upend their season."
2022,5,15,Las Vegas Raiders,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 21 It starts with one. It has to start with one. The Raiders finally cracked the win column on Sunday, opening the October portion of their schedule with a vitally important, potentially season-saving 32-23 win over the rival Broncos. The star of the day was Josh Jacobs , the former first-round pick who looked like a man reborn. Jacobs displayed speed, patience and power in a 144-yard, two-touchdown day. If he can keep this up, he'll go from a summertime-cut candidate to the recipient of a contract extension. A Week 5 matchup against the Chiefs is another tough lever pull by the schedule gods, but the Silver & Black can at least go into that Monday night matchup feeling good about themselves."
2022,5,16,Denver Broncos,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 14 We'll start with the good news: Russell Wilson is starting to look more like his old self . On Sunday, the quarterback connected on multiple downfield shots, kept plays alive with his legs and accounted for all three of Denver's scores. The bad news? Pretty much everything else. The Broncos lost to a division rival, their defense made Josh Jacobs look like Bo Jackson and Melvin Gordon had yet another killer fumble . Oh, and defensive end Randy Gregory and running back Javonte Williams were both carted off with knee injuries. Gregory will miss at least four games after undergoing knee surgery, but the news on Williams was especially dismaying: The former second-round pick's season was ended by a torn ACL/LCL , and there is an arduous journey ahead."
2022,5,17,Arizona Cardinals,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Another week, another slow start for a Cardinals offense that seems incapable of sustaining rhythm on a weekly basis. Luckily, the alarm clock on Kliff Kingsbury's attack went off in time for Arizona to put away a subpar Panthers team on Sunday . Suspended receiver DeAndre Hopkins can return after two more games. When he does, he'll find he now has a legitimate complement on the field in Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown . The offseason addition has given Kyler Murray a playmaker when Arizona needed one most. The Cards desperately missed someone like Brown opposite Hopkins in 2021 -- it will be fun to see what kind of music they can make together. We'll learn soon enough."
2022,5,18,New Orleans Saints,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 19 If I were NFL Commissioner, double-doinks from 61 yards out would count double. Unfortunately for the Saints ... I am not. Wil Lutz 's long-range attempt to force overtime was not meant to be, sending the Saints to Week 5 at 1-3 despite a game effort without Jameis Winston , Alvin Kamara or Michael Thomas in the lineup. Andy Dalton played well in the second half against the Vikings, and it remains an open question whether Dennis Allen will stick with the Red Rifle or turn back to Winston, who was ineffective in two games after suffering his Week 1 back injury. The Saints have yet to receive a productive four-quarter performance from a QB."
2022,5,19,New York Giants,3-1,"Previous rank: No. 22 Where would the Giants be without Saquon Barkley this season? The veteran running back is healthy and back to full-dynamo status, the driving reason behind Big Blue's surprising 3-1 start. Barkley's value reached unforeseen new levels on Sunday when New York lost both of its quarterbacks to injury, and Brian Daboll turned to his star to take direct snaps out of the Wildcat to seal a win over the Bears . The early schedule has been extremely favorable, but give the Giants credit. In an NFC defined by parity, the G-Men are stacking wins with an eye on an improbable playoff return."
2022,5,20,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 18 The learning process for Trevor Lawrence goes on. Playing in sloppy, wet conditions, the Jaguars' second-year quarterback lacked awareness in the pocket and was too careless with the football in a 29-21 loss to the Eagles. Lawrence fumbled the ball four times (losing all four) and threw a crushing red-zone interception -- an avalanche of giveaways that allowed the undefeated Eagles to wipe away an early 14-0 deficit. A tough game for Lawrence, but he gets an ideal bounce-back opponent on Sunday in the Texans ."
2022,5,21,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 17 Jacoby Brissett has thrown just two interceptions through four games, but they've both been killers. In Week 2, he sailed a pass that sealed Cleveland's fate in a collapse against the Jets. On Sunday, another Brissett misfire in the final minutes was the difference in a frustrating 23-20 loss to the Falcons. The Browns fell despite another big performance by Nick Chubb , who has three 100-yard games in four weeks and very much looks like the favorite for the NFL rushing title in 2022. The big question in Cleveland: When will Myles Garrett return to the lineup following his scary car accident last week? He is the engine that makes the Browns' defense go."
2022,5,22,Atlanta Falcons,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 25 Oh, those frisky Falcons. Second-year coach Arthur Smith continued to show signs of growth with a narrow win over the Browns in which the team went over 200 yards rushing for the second time in four weeks. Rookie Tyler Allgeier rumbled for 84 yards, and Caleb Huntley chipped in with 56 yards of his own. Cordarrelle Patterson found the end zone, but the knee injury that hampered him leading into the Browns' contest has now sent him to injured reserve for at least four weeks. Allgeier figures to get a bigger role in the offense, but the absence of Patterson will ramp up pressure on quarterback Marcus Mariota , who has run hot and cold in his four starts so far."
2022,5,23,Seattle Seahawks,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Seahawks traded Russell Wilson and have gotten better on offense. That's hard to deny after watching Geno Smith and superfriends pile up 555 total yards, 27 first downs and 48 points in a shootout win over the Lions at Ford Field. Smith finished 23 of 30 for 320 yards and three total touchdowns against a Detroit defense off to a historically inept start. Regardless of the opponent, the journeyman QB's command and execution of the Seattle attack counts as one of the season's biggest early surprises. ""(Shoot), he's been on fire all year,"" wide receiver DK Metcalf (7/149/0 on Sunday) said of Smith. ""He keeps building, keeps getting better week by week, and our chemistry keeps growing, and we're finally building an identity for ourselves."""
2022,5,24,Detroit Lions,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 You can have all the grit in the world, but if you don't have defense, none of it matters. Detroit continued to hemorrhage yards on Sunday, surrendering 555 of them to Geno Smith and a Seahawks attack that won't be confused with the 2007 Patriots anytime soon. The Lions' combination of high-flying offense and dismal defense is putting the team in the record books. According to NFL Media research, Detroit's total of 281 points -- 140 scored, 141 allowed -- are the most by any team in the first four games of a season in NFL history. The team deserves recognition for putting 45 points on Seattle with D'Andre Swift and Amon-Ra St. Brown out with injuries -- but if they allow 35.3 points per game, they'll be picking in the top five yet again come April."
2022,5,25,New England Patriots,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 24 The plan was not for fourth-round rookie Bailey Zappe to be taking snaps opposite of Aaron Rodgers on Sunday at Lambeau Field, but such is the nature of an unpredictable sport. Zappe did admirable work given a nearly impossible situation, making a few throws and avoiding multiple catastrophic mistakes, but the end result was still -- commendable as it was -- an overtime loss . With Mac Jones down with an ankle injury and Brian Hoyer exiting the Green Bay game with a head injury , itâs possible Zappe could get another audition for the top backup job on Sunday against the Lions . After decades of QB serenity with Tom Brady , Bill Belichick is now seeing how the other half lives."
2022,5,26,New York Jets,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 31 Welcome back, Zach Wilson . The second-year quarterback made his season debut a memorable one, leading the Jets on back-to-back touchdown drives in the fourth quarter of a 24-20 win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh. Wilson was predictably rusty in his first game action since knee surgery in August, but the former No. 2 pick was in control during the gameâs final scoring drive -- a 65-yard march in which Wilson went 5 for 5 through the air. When Breece Hall reached over the goal line -- juuuuust barely -- with the go-ahead TD, New York had its second stunning comeback in three weeks. Is the long-suffering franchise finally flipping the script after a decade of struggles? With Wilson back, the Jets have buzz."
2022,5,27,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 26 Mike Tomlin said he wasnât going to do it. He said Mitchell Trubisky was his guy at quarterback. Then Sundayâs game reached halftime and Tomlin decided heâd had his fill. Enter first-round pick Kenny Pickett , who scored two rushing touchdowns and threw 13 passes that never touched the ground. Unfortunately, three of those connections were to Jets defenders in a 24-20 loss at Acrisure Stadium. After the game, Tomlin chose not to commit to a Week 5 starter, but heâs in too deep now. Pickett has gone from future to present as Trubisky has rightfully returned to a reserve role. Tomlin likely resisted this direction initially because he didnât want to deal with rookie growing pains. In the end, Trubiskyâs neck-straining ceiling left the coach no choice."
2022,5,28,Indianapolis Colts,1-2-1,"Previous rank: No. 23 What is it that the Colts do really well right now? They canât beat you with their passing game, they struggle to protect their ancient quarterback, they donât move the ball on the ground (and now Jonathan Taylor is injured) and their special teams have already cost them one win. Their run defense entered Week 4 as a bright spot, but even that was exposed by Derrick Henry , who piled up 99 yards in the first half alone of Sundayâs 24-17 loss to the Titans . Have we mentioned Shaquille Leonard has already been ruled out for Thursdayâs game against the Broncos with a concussion? I donât mean to be a downer here ... but the vibes ... theyâre no good in Indy."
2022,5,29,Washington Commanders,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 30 Offense looks like hard work when youâre watching the Commanders. The pass protection is poor and Carson Wentz never seems comfortable as he repeatedly throws into tight windows. Washingtonâs struggles go beyond the quarterback, however. On Sunday against the Cowboys, there were 11 penalties for 136 yards, with two of those infractions wiping away Cooper Rush interceptions in a 25-10 loss . Ron Rivera is a respected figure throughout league circles, but this doesnât feel like an organization moving in the right direction. A quick glance at the NFC East standings backs up that notion."
2022,5,30,Chicago Bears,2-2,"Previous rank: No. 27 Justin Fields set a season high on Sunday with 11 completions and in no way is that depressing . Yes, the growing pains rolled on for the young former first-round pick, who took six sacks and had three trips inside the red zone without scoring a touchdown in a 20-12 loss to the Giants at MetLife Stadium. You can imagine Matt Eberflus finds himself in a difficult situation: Fields represents the possible future of the Bears organization, but heâs been unable to lead the offense with any efficiency. The new coach is tied to the young QB in his debut season, for better or worse."
2022,5,31,Carolina Panthers,1-3,"Previous rank: No. 29 With each passing week, itâs become increasingly clear the Panthers still have no answer at quarterback. Baker Mayfield struggled mightily yet again on Sunday against the Cardinals , missing open receivers and seeing several of his pass attempts swatted down at the line of scrimmage. Itâs time for a change, but itâs not that easy for Matt Rhule. It was reported -- and later confirmed by Rhule -- on Monday that Sam Darnold ( last yearâs offseason QB acquisition who didnât work out) is not close to returning from his high-ankle sprain , while third-round pick Matt Corral exited the picture in the summer after sustaining a foot injury . That means Rhule is probably stuck with Mayfield, who was on the receiving end of a resounding chorus of boos from the Panthers faithful on Sunday. The times, they are not good in Charlotte."
2022,5,32,Houston Texans,0-3-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans are winless through four games for the fourth time since the franchiseâs inception in 2002, but the news isnât all bad. Itâs become increasingly clear that running back Dameon Pierce was a draft steal in the fourth round. Pierce set a franchise rookie record with a 75-yard touchdown run that gave Houston some much-needed vitality in an eventual 34-24 loss to the Chargers. Pierce leads all rookie rushers with 313 yards on the ground and was finally granted a full workload by Lovie Smith. In fact, Pierce was the only running back who had a rushing attempt for the Texans in Week 4. Houston has a new horse."
2022,6,1,Buffalo Bills,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Steelers showed up to Western New York with a rookie quarterback making his first start and a defense playing without T.J. Watt . The results were as one-sided as you might expect: a 38-3 Bills victory that put Buffalo back in sole possession of first place in the AFC East. Josh Allen cut through 20 mph winds with ease, connecting on a pair of long TD passes to Gabriel Davis in a first half that included an absurd 348 passing yards for the star QB. Buffalo coasted from there, but Allen still managed to set a franchise record for passing yardage in a game that ended in regulation (424). When the Bills start cooking, there's not another team in the league that can handle the heat emanating from their kitchen."
2022,6,2,Philadelphia Eagles,5-0,"Previous rank: No. 1 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Eagles keep answering the bell in different ways. Win a shootout? Check. Blow a team off the field? Check. Rally from multiple scores down? Check. Win a close one in a hostile environment? Got that, too. Sunday's 20-17 triumph at Arizona came with a dollop of good fortune: Kyler Murray 's premature slide short of the first-down marker set up an ugly miss by a temporary kicker to close the game. But you tend to get these kinds of breaks when things are going good. ""Every win isn't easy,"" Jalen Hurts said. ""Personally, I have mixed emotions about the game itself, but we found a way."" The Eagles are 5-0 for just the third time in franchise history."
2022,6,3,Kansas City Chiefs,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 3 Can't say I'm totally on board with the Never Cover Travis Kelce strategy deployed by the Raiders on the goal line, but the Chiefs weren't complaining after their star tight end gobbled up all four of Patrick Mahomes ' short touchdown passes in a 30-29 prime-time win at Arrowhead. Kansas City dug itself out of a 17-0 first-half hole thanks to a Mahomes-led offense that, when warmed up, operates like a runaway freight train going downhill. Kelce remains at the center of everything, a prodigious producer who always seems to deliver his best moments when the lights are brightest. In an NFL bereft of consistent playmaking at tight end, Kelce is a cheat-code outlier."
2022,6,4,San Francisco 49ers,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 5 The 49ers took care of business against a Panthers team set adrift, coasting to a 37-15 road win that put San Francisco in sole possession of first place in the muddled NFC West. The victory came at a cost, however: Emmanuel Moseley , a rising star at cornerback who registered a pick-six on Sunday, tore the ACL in his left knee and is out for the season. San Francisco also finished the game without star pass rusher Nick Bosa ( groin ) and kicker Robbie Gould (knee). Any length of absence for Bosa will be felt: The two-time Pro Bowler entered Sunday leading the NFL in sacks and pressures."
2022,6,5,Baltimore Ravens,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 7 We hope the Ravens and their fans never take for granted the unprecedented greatness of Justin Tucker . The best kicker in NFL history was at it again on Sunday night, booting a 58-yard field goal in the third quarter, then the game-winner as time expired to lift the Ravens to a critical 19-17 win over the rival Bengals. Per Next Gen Stats, Tucker's 43-yard clincher quite literally split the uprights. Tucker is 17-for-17 lifetime on attempts in the final minute of regulation. Said Lamar Jackson : "" We got the G.O.A.T. at kicker ."" It's the truth -- and it gives the Ravens a huge advantage in every close contest they're a part of."
2022,6,6,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 8 The Bucs continue to trudge through the early portion of their schedule, winning more often than not but rarely looking like a team that's playing to its full potential. The defense bounced back from Week 4's humbling prime-time loss to the Chiefs , but a fourth-quarter letdown was halted by an absurdly generous roughing-the-passer call that kept Tom Brady on the field and allowed the home team to run out the clock in a 21-15 win over Atlanta. It's a break the Bucs won't apologize for ... and they shouldn't. But they will need to be sharper when the schedule tightens up again. ""Five games in, and we've got a lot of work to do,"" Brady said. ""We're not nearly at the point of where we're capable of being."""
2022,6,7,Minnesota Vikings,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 9 You can flip the calendar and reboot the coaching staff, but some things will never change with a Kirk Cousins -led offense. Take Sunday, for instance: Cousins completed his first 17 passes against the Bears, leading the Vikings to touchdowns on their first three possessions while building a 21-3 lead. The blowout was on! Until it wasn't. The offense went cold, and Minnesota allowed Chicago to crawl back in the game and even take the lead in the fourth quarter. Then Cousins and Co. regrouped to score the go-ahead touchdown in an eventual 29-22 win , but the hot-and-cold nature of the Vikings' attack remains mystifying. ""I'm not where I was at the end of last season in that old system,"" Cousins said, ""but we're developing it and we're getting there and I'm excited about that continued growth."""
2022,6,8,Green Bay Packers,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 4 On paper, the Packers would appear to have a dominant defense. But that's not what we've seen on the field this season. For the second straight week, Green Bay failed to make key stops against an offense compromised by injuries . The Packers survived a scare from Bailey Zappe and the Patriots in Week 4 , but Brian Daboll's Giants made them pay with a humbling loss in London. It's not all on the D. Aaron Rodgers and the Packers' offense were shut out in the second half and continue to search for their big-play identity in a post-Davante world. Per NFL Media research, Rodgers finished 0-for-6 on deep attempts of at least 20 air yards."
2022,6,9,Cincinnati Bengals,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 Joe Burrow and the Bengals' offense seemed well set up to shred a Ravens defense that entered Sunday Night Football allowing more passing yardage than any team in football. Unfortunately for Cincinnati, past performance was not indicative of future results. Burrow struggled to attack downfield, with Tee Higgins sidelined by an ankle injury , while Ja'Marr Chase was (again) limited to modest gains in a 19-17 loss to the Ravens. By the end of last season, Chase was a YAC monster who could not be contained. Bengals coach Zac Taylor needs to pop the hood on his offense and figure out why that's no longer the case."
2022,6,10,Dallas Cowboys,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 The stellar Cowboys defense has produced one of my favorite, most straightforward stats of the 2022 NFL season: Dallas has allowed exactly one touchdown in each of its five games this season. The defending champion Rams were the latest team to go one-and-done in a 22-10 Cowboys win at SoFi Stadium. The offensive star was Tony Pollard , whose 57-yard touchdown run gave Dallas the lead back for good and served as the latest reminder that Ezekiel Elliott is not the best running back on Mike McCarthyâs team. Speaking of McCarthy, we loved his line from last Thursday when alerted by a reporter that the Rams were favored in Sundayâs game. Replied the coach: â Weâre nobodyâs underdog .â Indeed."
2022,6,11,Tennessee Titans,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Titans have had rotten injury luck all season, and you could see the cracks along the offensive line in a 21-17 win over the Commanders. Dennis Daley (starting at left tackle after Taylor Lewan 's season-ending knee injury ) was bullied by Montez Sweat , while the interior line struggled on a day Ryan Tannehill absorbed five sacks. The offense did manage to crack the end zone three times, and David Long Jr. stepped up with the goal-line interception in the final seconds to secure a win. The Titans are a team that's still trying to figure things out; luckily, they play in an AFC South that appears more adrift than ever at the moment."
2022,6,12,Los Angeles Chargers,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 14 Brandon Staley owes Cade York a beer. York pushed his 54-yard field-goal attempt wide right in the final seconds, allowing the Chargers to escape Cleveland with a 30-28 win . Minutes earlier -- in a decision that was gutsy at best and reckless at worst -- Staley opted to keep his offense on the field on fourth-and-2 at his own 45-yard line with just over a minute to play. When Justin Herbert 's subsequent pass fell incomplete , the Browns looked like a team given an early Christmas gift by the opposing head coach. But credit the Los Angeles defense, which stood strong and forced the long field-goal attempt. ""So glad he missed that,"" tweeted Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen , inactive with a hamstring injury. ""Cause man, man, man."""
2022,6,13,New York Giants,4-1,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Giants aren't the most talented team in the NFC, and they're far from the healthiest , but they compete like hell and put themselves in the best position to win each week. We saw that again on Sunday in London, where Big Blue scored an eye-opening 27-22 comeback victory over the Packers. Defensive coordinator Don ""Wink"" Martindale cooked up a scheme that didn't allow Aaron Rodgers to score chunk plays (Green Bay was shut out on offense in the second half), while the undermanned offense was once again the recipient of multiple impact plays from Saquon Barkley , who absolutely deserves to be in any MVP conversation through five weeks. Speaking of five weeks, that's how long it took the Giants to match their win total from 2021."
2022,6,14,Las Vegas Raiders,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 The script is beyond tired for the Raiders. Josh McDaniels' team was once again on the wrong side of a coin-flip game, this time an excruciating 30-29 defeat to the Chiefs at Arrowhead that dropped Vegas into the AFC West cellar. The circumstances on Monday night were particularly cruel: Josh Jacobs came up inches short on a 2-point conversion try that would have put the Raiders ahead with 4:27 to play. On the ensuing possession, Davante Adams had a sideline reception to put the team in field-goal range in the final seconds wiped away by an official review. When Adams and Hunter Renfrow collided on the subsequent fourth-and-1 pass attempt , it was a fitting end to an infuriating night -- another chapter in an infuriating season -- for the team from the desert."
2022,6,15,Los Angeles Rams,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 11 Los Angeles is a defending Super Bowl champion with a broken offense. It's Sean McVay's responsibility to figure out how to fix it before it's too late. The Rams managed just one long Cooper Kupp touchdown and 323 yards of total offense in a 22-10 loss to the Cowboys at SoFi. Kupp's score represents the team's only touchdown in the past nine quarters. Afterward, McVay shut down the idea of putting the blame at the feet of the quarterback. ""I love Matthew Stafford . He is competing and doing everything in his power for this team, (and) he needs some help,"" McVay said . ""I think he's doing everything he can. I think he needs more help."""
2022,6,16,New Orleans Saints,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 18 That was it. The idealized version of the Taysom Hill Experience. The Saints' jack of all trades was at his very best against a porous Seahawks defense, rushing for three scores and throwing for another in a 39-32 win . His final touchdown, a breakaway 60-yard jaunt with less than six minutes to play, was the difference-maker, as New Orleans snapped its three-game losing streak. With Jameis Winston and Michael Thomas sidelined, Hill got help from Alvin Kamara , who piled up 194 yards of total offense and looked -- for the first time in quite a while -- like, well, Alvin Kamara . He remains the Jenga piece of the Saints' attack -- the whole thing topples over without the running back doing his thing."
2022,6,17,New York Jets,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Jets closed out Sundayâs 40-17 win over the Dolphins like a young team thatâs starting to believe in itself. New York used a dominant rushing attack and big-play defense to reel off 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter, snapping a 12-game losing streak versus AFC East opponents. Carl Lawson sealed the win with a strip sack of Dolphins third-string QB Skylar Thompson (a play that allowed Quinnen Williams to stiff-arm "" disrespectful "" Tyreek Hill into another time zone), while Breece Hall announced his arrival as an Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate with 197 total yards and a score. Returns have been exceedingly positive on a 2022 draft class that includes instant-impact starters in Hall, cornerback Sauce Gardner and wide receiver Garrett Wilson . Tip your cap to Joe Douglas."
2022,6,18,Miami Dolphins,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Dolphins have cooled off after their hot start, and injuries at the gameâs most important position help to explain why. Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) sat out Sunday's game against the Jets, and backup Teddy Bridgewater lasted one play before he, too, was sidelined after being evaluated for a head injury. Bridgewater passed the tests administered by doctors on Sunday, but was ruled out due to the new ""ataxia"" addendum to the league's concussion protocols. Third-string QB Skylar Thompson performed admirably on short notice, but struggled to take advantage of Miami's explosive playmakers. The result was an average Dolphins attack  that all but disappeared in the fourth quarter, when the Jets reeled off 21 unanswered points to turn a tight contest into a laugher for the home team in green."
2022,6,19,Arizona Cardinals,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 17 The best teams find ways to win. On Sunday, the Cardinals found ways to lose. A scrambling Kyler Murray went into a protection slide just short of the first-down marker, setting in motion a chain of events that ended with fill-in kicker Matt Ammendola badly pushing a 43-yard field goal attempt wide right . The end result? A painful 20-17 loss to the Eagles, ruining what could have been a major statement win against the NFL's lone undefeated team. ""We've got a lot of season left,"" Murray said. ""We've got a great team, great locker room. I am confident in everybody in that locker room. We've got to get it together. Right now, we're not playing complementary football."""
2022,6,20,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Browns are quietly having an absurd season. Cleveland has played five games, won two and allowed victory to slip away in brutal fashion in three defeats. Jacoby Brissett is at the center of all the madness. The backup QB has played the best football of his career, but each of his three interceptions have come at crucial late junctures to seal -- or help seal -- the Browns' fate in their losses. On Sunday, it was a killer end-zone pick with less than three minutes to play in a 30-28 defeat to the Chargers. Brissett threw 34 passes in the loss, or double the amount of carries Nick Chubb had in the game. Kevin Stefanski might want to make an adjustment there."
2022,6,21,New England Patriots,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 25 We no longer live in the days of endless summer in Foxborough, but you have to give the organization -- and specifically, Bill Belichick -- credit: If you come into New England and arenât ready, you can still be embarrassed. Case in point, the Lions, who showed up Sunday with the highest-scoring offense in football but headed back to Detroit as 29-0 losers . The Pats attacked the Swiss-cheese Detroit defense on the ground, while Belichickâs defensive scheme put Jared Goff in a mental blender. The Pats are a Week 6 win over the Browns away from getting back to even ground at .500. Will Mac Jones (ankle) be back in the lineup?"
2022,6,22,Atlanta Falcons,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 22 In another dimension, the referee keeps the penalty flag in his pocket, Marcus Mariota takes the field after a Bucs punt, and the Falcons score a touchdown in the final seconds to shock Tom Brady back into retirement. Unfortunately for Atlanta, a flag ( for unnecessary roughness ) was thrown on Grady Jarrett 's pivotal fourth-quarter sack, and the opportunity to complete a stirring comeback was taken from Arthur Smith's bunch. ""I'm not talking today,"" Jarrett said after the game. We feel you, big man. After the loss, the team announced the trade of Pro Bowl linebacker Deion Jones and a seventh-round draft pick to the Browns in exchange for a sixth-round pick."
2022,6,23,Denver Broncos,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 Itâs not too early to panic . Russell Wilson and the Broncos' offense delivered another anemic performance under the prime-time lights, a 12-9 overtime loss that fully exposed to the football-viewing public how broken Denverâs attack appears to be five weeks into the season. Embattled first-year coach Nathaniel Hackett deserves his share of the blame for the struggles, but itâs Wilson who was supposed to elevate the Broncos to title contenders. Instead, heâs held them back with inconsistent play and costly mistakes. That Wilson underwent a procedure on his throwing shoulder on Friday only summons more storm clouds over Mile High."
2022,6,24,Seattle Seahawks,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 23 The Seahawks are an entertaining team, but a consistently overmatched defense might stop them from being anything more than that. A week after getting pushed around by the Jared Goff-led Lions , it was the Saintsâ turn -- Taysom Hill (accounted for four touchdowns) and Alvin Kamara (194 total yards) did pretty much whatever they wanted in a 39-32 Seattle loss . Itâs a shame, too, because Geno Smith continues to defy expectations as one of the NFLâs best passers through five weeks. Geno will be without a key piece going forward: Rashaad Penny is done for the year after fracturing his fibula on Sunday . Penny is a talented player who canât shake the injury bug ."
2022,6,25,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 20 Trevor Lawrence had a five-turnover meltdown against the Eagles in Week 4 , but you could point to the wet and slippery conditions as a major factor behind his struggles. But Sunday? A home game in good conditions against the winless Texans? Lawrence should have been far better than his two-interception, zero-touchdown showing in a disappointing 13-6 loss . Lawrence got a pass for a rocky rookie year marred by Urban Meyerâs malfeasance, but the five-game sample Lawrence has submitted in Year 2 under Doug Pederson has been frustratingly inconsistent. It's time for Lawrence, touted as a generational talent entering the league, to step up."
2022,6,26,Detroit Lions,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Lions have been a mess on defense all season, but the offense was there to keep the team competitive and afloat. Sundayâs 29-0 loss to the Patriots is what happens when Jared Goff and Co. donât put their best foot forward. The cracks are showing for a Dan Campbell regime that is high on charisma and likability, but still dangerously low on tangible success. ""To me, this is about as bad as it gets,â the coach said Sunday . â... I believe we hit rock bottom, so now the only place to go is back up."" Detroit will use its bye to examine everything, including fourth-down decision making: The Lions went for it on fourth down six times on Sunday and failed to convert even once."
2022,6,27,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Steelers were overmatched by a vastly superior Bills team on Sunday, falling behind by four touchdowns by halftime in an eventual 38-3 loss in Western New York. Pittsburghâs defense -- lost without T.J. Watt -- surrendered a 98-yard touchdown strike from Josh Allen on the third play from scrimmage and rarely looked competitive after that. Mike Tomlin didnât mince words after the game. ""Satisfied with the effort?â the coach replied to a reporterâs query. âWe got smashed. What are we doing here, man?"" With an unforgiving schedule ahead, Tomlin appears destined to finally endure his first losing season as head coach. Itâs fair to wonder if Pittsburgh ends this rebuilding campaign with one of the worst records in football."
2022,6,28,Indianapolis Colts,2-2-1,"Previous rank: No. 28 When it was over, the Colts were celebrating in Denver on Thursday night -- even if the result didnât quite make sense. Per The Athletic , Quenton Nelson had this to say after the 12-9 overtime conquest : âA winâs a win, but Iâm kinda also like â¦ how ?â The Colts can thank their defense for keeping the team above water during a brutal opening stretch for an offense that has averaged a league-worst 13.8 points per game. The prime-time star was Stephon Gilmore , the veteran cover man who intercepted Russell Wilson to thwart one red-zone drive and broke up an end-zone pass in the final seconds to ice the game. Ugly wins count just as much as pretty ones, but Matt Ryan and Co. will need to be far better to move Indy out of the pretender category."
2022,6,29,Chicago Bears,2-3,"Previous rank: No. 30 Sometimes a loss can feel like a win. Thatâs how Bears fans could optimistically look at a 29-22 setback to the Vikings that also served as a hopeful jumping-off point for Justin Fields . The quarterback, who had struggled mightily through the first four weeks of his second season, caught fire in the second half, finishing 12 of 13 for 135 yards and a touchdown in the final two quarters. He added 36 rushing yards and had a long TD run negated by a penalty. Fieldsâ hot streak allowed Chicago to erase a 21-3 deficit and put a serious scare into the NFC North leaders. ""I think we took a step forward, for sure,"" Fields said. ""A lot of teams in this league would have just laid down and stopped playing."" Itâs a start."
2022,6,30,Washington Commanders,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 29 Itâs never a comfortable watch with Carson Wentz . There are twists, there are turns, thereâs joy, thereâs terror. Oh, and a fair bit of tragedy, like the goal-line interception thrown by the quarterback in the final seconds of a 21-17 loss to the Titans . Wentzâs deciding turnover overshadowed a 359-yard passing day that included two long touchdown tosses to Dyami Brown . At 1-4, Washington finds itself buried in last place of a division with two 4-1 teams and one 5-0 team. ""We have dug a hole, but at the same time, there's a lot of games left, a lot of football,"" Wentz said. ""The NFL is crazy. We try not to look at what happened the last couple of games and what's ahead. We just got to go 1-0 each week. We've dug ourselves a hole. We did it to ourselves."""
2022,6,31,Houston Texans,1-3-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans have joined the ranks of the living, with their first win of the season. They did it with a strong defensive effort against the Jaguars, harassing Trevor Lawrence into two interceptions in a 13-6 victory . Rookie Derek Stingley Jr. had one of those picks, his first career interception . There was more good news for the rookie class on the other side of the ball: Dameon Pierce rushed for 99 yards and his third touchdown of the season. Through five weeks, Pierce is fifth in the league in rushing, averaging a plump 4.8 yards per attempt. That kind of production places the fourth-round pick firmly in the Offensive Rookie of the Year discussion."
2022,6,32,Carolina Panthers,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 31 The Panthers were non-competitive yet again on Sunday against the 49ers. Less than 24 hours later, the ax came down on Matt Rhule. Carolina fired the head coach on Monday, ending his run with the Panthers at 11-27 in two-plus seasons. Rhule didnât fail alone: The Panthers have had dreadful instincts in addressing the quarterback position since cutting ties with former MVP Cam Newton. Sam Darnold was a bust in 2021, and Baker Mayfield has been just as bad (if not worse) as QB1 this year. Itâs been a mess, and now it becomes the responsibility of defensive passing game coordinator/secondary coach Steve Wilks, who was elevated to interim head coach. Wilks will begin his run without Mayfield, out indefinitely after suffering a high ankle sprain against the Niners. With Darnold still shelved by his own high ankle sprain (this team, man), P.J. Walker is set to start Sunday against the Rams ."
2022,7,1,Buffalo Bills,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Chiefs believed sending extra rushers at Josh Allen could neutralize the Bills' superstar quarterback. They learned a hard lesson. Allen hung in the pocket and delivered touchdown strikes to Gabe Davis and Stefon Diggs when facing the blitz , huge plays that helped secure a 24-20 "" revenge "" win against the rival Chiefs at Arrowhead. While Allen was doing his MVP act on one side of the ball, Von Miller was again making Buffalo's brass look like a genius collective by delivering a two-sack day and the QB pressure that led to Patrick Mahomes ' game-clinching interception in the fourth quarter. With the win, the Bills gain a tiebreaker advantage that could have major ramifications come January."
2022,7,2,Philadelphia Eagles,6-0,"Previous rank: No. 2 Everybody wants to be known as a ""fourth-quarter team,"" but there's something to be said for stealing the soul from your opponent in the second quarter, too. From the NFL Media Research Department: The Eagles have scored 112 second-quarter points in 2022, the most points in any quarter in NFL history through a team's first six games. Football's lone undefeated team, Philly will come out of its Week 7 bye facing a favorable schedule, with three straight games against teams owning two or fewer wins through Week 6. The road to 9-0 is clear for Nick Sirianni's rowdy gang of spirit-swiping marauders."
2022,7,3,Kansas City Chiefs,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 The stage was set for more Mahomes Magic against the Bills at Arrowhead, but this time, it was the visitors celebrating in the end. Patrick Mahomes was pressured by Von Miller -- a star playing on the other side of the country when these teams met in January's Divisional Playoffs -- before Mahomes tossed the game-deciding interception late in the fourth quarter. The pick sealed a 24-20 loss against a rival that Kansas City will likely see again come January. ""It was a great battle. You love these games,"" Andy Reid said. ""You just don't want to be sitting on this end of it. But you love the competition and the way the guys get after it."""
2022,7,4,Minnesota Vikings,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 Minnesota isn't anybody's idea of a juggernaut, but five wins in six games -- picked off only by the undefeated Eagles -- tells the story of a team that knows how to close. The Vikings did it again on Sunday in Miami , forcing a huge turnover as the Dolphins were marching toward the go-ahead score; then Dalvin Cook found a crease for the long touchdown run to ice the game . ""It's very much the inverse of 2021,"" said Kirk Cousins , invoking the salty ghosts of the Mike Zimmer era. ""I would walk off of the field after a loss and say: 'Man, we're playing so well. We're playing so well!' Somehow, some way, we lost. This year, it's, 'Gosh, we can play better.' But we win. I'll take this any day."""
2022,7,5,Cincinnati Bengals,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 Sunday's 30-26 win over the Saints was one of those games where you think to yourself, Man, this Joe Burrow dude is special. The third-year quarterback tallied 300 yards through the air and improvised brilliantly on the scramble in a successful Superdome homecoming for the LSU legend. Speaking of LSU, Burrow made magic with former Tigers teammate Ja'Marr Chase (7/132/2), who put the Bengals ahead for good via a 60-yard catch-and-run score with two minutes to play. Chase had been bottled up for much of the season until the second half on Sunday. Burrow and Chase are fixin' to go on a rampage."
2022,7,6,Dallas Cowboys,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 10 It's time for Dak Prescott to rejoin the gang . Cooper Rush 's run as an undefeated starting QB came to an unceremonious end on Sunday Night Football , as the Eagles picked off the Dallas passer three times in a 26-17 loss at the Linc. Rush struggled in new territory at QB1, playing from behind in a difficult road environment. The results weren't surprising, but Rush deserves credit for doing his part to keep the season afloat while Dak worked his way back from thumb surgery. Early reports point to a Prescott return this Sunday against the Lions ."
2022,7,7,New York Giants,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 If you let the Giants hang around in a game, there's a good chance they'll find a way to beat you. We saw it again on Sunday at the Meadowlands, where Big Blue forced two Lamar Jackson turnovers in successive possessions in the fourth quarter to steal a 24-20 win from the Ravens. Much credit is in order for Don ""Wink"" Martindale, who cooked up another fine defensive game plan that neutralized Jackson and allowed the offense to wipe away a 10-point deficit in the second half. This is old hat by now: The Giants are 3-1 in games in which they trailed by double digits."
2022,7,8,Baltimore Ravens,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 Lamar Jackson is a former MVP who has had stretches this season when heâs looked better than ever. But the quarterback also bears his share of the responsibility for three confounding late-game meltdowns that have defined a .500 start. On Sunday, Jackson buried Baltimore with two fourth-quarter turnovers -- a grisly interception that set up Saquon Barkley âs go-ahead score and a strip-sack fumble that aborted a comeback attempt -- in a frustrating 24-20 loss to the upstart Giants. The Ravens are up to three losses in which they led by at least 10 points in a game -- matching a team record for most such losses in a season. Through Week 6!"
2022,7,9,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 Why is offense so hard for the team with Tom Brady ? Tampa Bay had to fight for every yard on Sunday in Pittsburgh, struggling to make impact plays against a Steelers team without reigning Defensive Player of the Year T.J. Watt or multiple starters in its secondary. Brady, who missed Saturdayâs team walkthrough to attend the wedding of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, was uncharacteristically inaccurate, while the offensive line struggled to get any push at the point of attack. Even a Brady QB sneak -- money in the bank for two decades -- produced zero gain on a key third down. The Bucs are in search mode."
2022,7,10,Los Angeles Chargers,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 12 What to make of the latest Chargers win, a 19-16 overtime conquest of the Broncos? The defense certainly did its job, regularly harassing Russell Wilson and reducing Denver's ""attack"" to rubble after a fast start. But what has happened to the L.A. offense? Justin Herbert looked positively pedestrian, averaging 4.2 yards per attempt while leading Los Angeles on a single touchdown drive. At his best, Herbert attacks defenses downfield like no other quarterback, but a prime-time showcase put the gunslinger in constant checkdown mode to Austin Ekeler (10 catches on 16 targets). An elite Broncos defense certainly played a part, but the Bolts can be better."
2022,7,11,San Francisco 49ers,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 The 49ers are watching another season get turned upside down by injuries. This, from ESPN : By the end of Sundayâs 28-14 loss to the Falcons, the Niners were down to four of 11 projected starters on their defense: linebackers Fred Warner and Dre Greenlaw , safety Talanoa Hufanga and end Samson Ebukam . On Monday, Hufanga -- a breakout contributor this season -- was placed in the concussion protocol . It was obvious how attrition affected San Franciscoâs performance against a middling Falcons attack, and wins will remain scarce if Jimmy Garoppolo and the offense canât flip a switch. That didnât happen in Atlanta, where the visitors were shut out in the second half."
2022,7,12,Los Angeles Rams,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Rams had the perfect get-right opponent on Sunday in the Panthers, who put up little resistance in the second half of a 24-10 win at SoFi. Los Angeles has struggled to find consistency and comfort with its offense since Week 1, but there were genuine signs of life on back-to-back touchdown drives in the third and fourth quarters that put the game away and sent Sean McVayâs team into its bye feeling better about itself. McVay gave out a game ball to his offensive line after the game, but victory was Pyrrhic on that front: Left tackle Joe Noteboom was carted off the field with a torn Achilles. It will be next man up at one of the teamâs most vital positions."
2022,7,13,New York Jets,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Jets went to Lambeau Field and secured their biggest win in years. The 27-10 beatdown of the Packers was stunning in how easy it felt for New York, a former doormat that entered the season with the NFLâs longest postseason drought at 11 years. Robert Salehâs young playmakers impacted the game at every level: Sauce Gardner was a constant menace in the secondary, Breece Hall went for more than 100 yards on the ground with the clinching touchdown run , while Quinnen Williams and a surging front four punished Aaron Rodgers and lived in the backfield all afternoon. When it was over, Gardner jogged around Lambeau wearing a Cheesehead -- an act of defiance and a message to the league: The Baby Jets have arrived."
2022,7,14,Tennessee Titans,3-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 The bye came at an ideal time for the Titans, who survived the first five weeks despite an avalanche of injuries to key players. Nate Davis , Amani Hooker , Ola Adeniyi and Zach Cunningham are all working their way back to the lineup as the team prepares for a big Sunday tilt against the rival Colts . Letâs stay optimistic: The Titans started the season 0-2 and hit their bye at 3-2 -- that's the exact record Mike Vrabelâs team held through five games one year ago. Those Titans finished 12-5 and claimed the top seed in the AFC. In a weak division and with improved health, Tennessee should again have a path back to double-digit wins."
2022,7,15,Green Bay Packers,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 This is no longer just about an underachieving defense or an offense trying to find itself. The entire operation seems to be out of sync in Green Bay, where the Packers fell back to .500 with a lopsided loss to the Jets at Lambeau. After the game, a beaten-down Aaron Rodgers spoke of r emoving complexities within the offense -- a well-worn trope for players questioning the philosophies of a coaching staff. ""I'm not attacking anything,"" Rodgers said. ""I just think that, based on how we've played the last two weeks, I think it's going to be in our best interests to simplify things for everybody. ... Just simplify some things, and maybe that'll help us get back on track."""
2022,7,16,Las Vegas Raiders,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Raiders are the best 1-4 team in football, but that type of compliment doesnât get you far in the NFL. The good news? Vegas comes out of its bye with a very favorable schedule that should put Josh McDanielsâ team in good position to get off the mat. The Raidersâ next six opponents are a combined 13-20-2. Catching the Chiefs in the AFC West might be a reach, but jumping back into the playoff race is well within reason."
2022,7,17,New England Patriots,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 21 Forget any contrived talk of a quarterback controversy. Mac Jones is a 2021 first-round pick who will resume QB1 duties once his ankle is healthy enough to allow it. But when that happens, Bill Belichick can rest easy knowing he has a battle-tested rookie backup with legitimate potential. Bailey Zappe , the fourth-round pick out of Western Kentucky, had his best game as a pro in a 38-15 win over the Browns, completing 24 of 34 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. Zappe was poised and had the offense in rhythm -- four different Pats players finished with at least 60 receiving yards. A New England staff with former head coach castoffs was an easy punchline during the summer. Who's laughing now?"
2022,7,18,Atlanta Falcons,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Falcons showed in the early weeks of the season how they can be competitive with just about anyone. On Sunday, they displayed their potential when they put forth a complete effort. Marcus Mariota was nearly perfect , connecting on 13 of 14 passes for 129 yards and two touchdowns (he added 50 yards on the ground), while Dean Pees' defense scored on a fumble recovery and pitched a second-half shutout in a 28-14 win over the 49ers. The outcome represented a season high for points scored and a season low for points allowed by the Falcons, who are tied with the Bucs atop the NFC South through six weeks. In a wide-open NFC, anything is possible."
2022,7,19,New Orleans Saints,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 16 So who's the starting quarterback of this team? Jameis Winston returned to practice last week and was active on Sunday, but it was still Andy Dalton at the controls in a 30-26 loss to the Bengals. Both veterans are 1-2 in their 2022 runs as starters, but Dalton has been given less to work with -- New Orleans once again played without its top three receivers against Cincinnati. On a short week, coach Dennis Allen is choosing the mystery approach: ""He's not 100 percent healthy,"" Allen said of Winston after the loss. ""We have a Thursday night game . Let's get into study on that, see where he is at, and then we will go from there."""
2022,7,20,Seattle Seahawks,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 24 Geno Smith 's surprisingly explosive offense has been the dominant storyline around the Seahawks this season, but one can imagine Pete Carroll loved the script being flipped by his defense on Sunday. Seattleâs D limited the Cardinals to only a game-opening field goal drive in the Seahawks' 19-9 win . (Arizonaâs other six points came on a special teams bust by the Seattle punt unit.) Meanwhile, cornerback Tariq Woolen is making himself a player in the Defensive Rookie of the Year competition: The fifth-round pick iced Sundayâs win with his fourth interception in as many games."
2022,7,21,Indianapolis Colts,3-2-1,"Previous rank: No. 28 Matty Ice lives! Forced to play another game without star running back Jonathan Taylor (ankle), Colts coach Frank Reich rolled out a pass-drunk attack that thrived in a 34-27 win over the Jaguars. Playing behind a revamped offensive line , Matt Ryan threw for 389 yards and three touchdowns on 42-of-58 passing. Ryan didn't commit a turnover and, remarkably, never took a single sack despite all those dropbacks. Ryan certainly played his role in Indianapolis' uninspired start to its season, but Sunday served as a welcome reminder he can still sling it when given time to read defenses and make plays."
2022,7,22,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 27 Just when all hope appeared lost, Mitch Trubisky stepped out of the shadows to save the Pittsburgh Steelers. The veteran QB, who lost his starting job back in Week 4, replaced a concussed Kenny Pickett vs. Tampa Bay and led Pittsburgh on a scoring drive before icing the game with two huge third-and-long conversions to Chase Claypool and a designed run play that produced the clinching first down. Mike Tomlin's undermanned defense also stepped up, putting continual pressure on Tom Brady with a four-man rush led by Cam Heyward and Larry Ogunjobi . The Bucs looked out of sync all game -- no small feat, considering how many key players were unavailable for the Steelers."
2022,7,23,Miami Dolphins,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 18 In a way, it feels like the 2022 Miami Dolphins had their season paused the moment Tua Tagovailoa 's helmet smacked the turf on that ugly Thursday night in Cincinnati. At that moment, Miami was 3-0 and one of the biggest stories of a young season. Three weeks (and losses) later, the Dolphins still haven't had a quarterback who was able to finish a game he started. ""I'm going to demand that the team does not point at [QB injuries] to be a reason for what's happened or a reason for the loss,"" Mike McDaniel said after a 24-16 setback to the Vikings. ""I think that's the easy thing to do."" Tua cleared concussion protocol last week and is expected to be ready to return on Sunday Night Football against the Steelers . The Dolphins are ready to hit play on their season."
2022,7,24,Denver Broncos,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 23 It began with signs of progress. Russell Wilson completed his first 10 passes, including a 39-yard touchdown strike to tight end Greg Dulcich . Then, as has been the case all season, the Broncos and their maddening offense went into a deep sleep. The 19-16 overtime loss to the Chargers -- Denver's second straight OT setback -- underlined a hard reality: The Broncos have the worst offense in football, with no clear path to improvement. ""They've got too many good players to consistently be this poor,"" ESPN's Troy Aikman said after another fruitless Denver possession in the fourth quarter. ""At least, I think they do. Maybe they don't."" We feel you, 8."
2022,7,25,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 20 The Browns have major problems on defense, and it's not getting better. The Patriots, led by fourth-round rookie Bailey Zappe , took it to Cleveland in a 38-15 thumping that brought out the boo birds at FirstEnergy Stadium. Pressure is building around head coach Kevin Stefanski, which could be bad news for defensive coordinator Joe Woods, who presides over a unit that has allowed 27.2 points per game (29th in the league). ""Every way you can get beat -- offense, defense, special teams, coaching -- we got beat,"" said Stefanski, attempting to spread the blame after the loss. ""They beat us, and we also beat ourselves a few too many times."""
2022,7,26,Arizona Cardinals,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Cardinals' offense is broken . Does the team have the right tools (and the right carpenter in Kliff Kingsbury) to get it fixed? Arizonaâs attack managed an opening drive field goal and nothing else in a 19-9 loss to the Seahawks, the same Seahawks who had surrendered a combined 84 points in the previous two games against the Lions and Saints . The news got worse Monday when it was learned Marquise âHollywoodâ Brown suffered a foot injury against Seattle that is believed to be serious. Brown has pretty much been the lone bright spot for Arizonaâs offense, and now he exits just as DeAndre Hopkins returns from suspension. On Monday, the Cardinals pivoted by agreeing to a trade that brings Robbie Anderson to the desert. Good luck with that."
2022,7,27,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 25 The Jaguars couldnât make the big stop to finish the Colts, the end result a 34-27 loss that Jacksonville could ill-afford after dropping its previous two games. An absentee pass rush played a major role: The Colts were forced into a pass-happy approach with their top two running backs injured and inactive, but the Jags couldnât manage a single sack against the statue-like Matt Ryan despite the veteran throwing 58 passes. Doug Pedersonâs team recorded just six QB hits, with no Jags player tallying more than one. Thatâs not gonna work."
2022,7,28,Detroit Lions,1-4,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Lions hit their bye week looking for answers on defense. Aidan Hutchinson , selected No. 2 overall in Aprilâs draft, is searching with the rest of his teammates right now. Hutchinson had three sacks and two tackles for loss in a Week 2 win over the Commanders. Heâs had zero sacks and just three QB hits combined in Detroitâs other four games -- all losses. A pop under the hood shows more struggles: According to Pro Football Focus, Hutchinsonâs pass-rush win rate is 8.9 percent, which ranks 107th out of 156 qualified players. Does this mean âHutchâ is a bust? Of course not -- but the rookie is just one of many Detroit defenders who need to raise their game."
2022,7,29,Chicago Bears,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 29 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ If Darnell Mooney makes a clean catch at the goal line , the Bears are back at .500, with Justin Fields and the offense getting praise for stacking back-to-back promising weeks. But Mooneyâs juggle cost Chicago the go-ahead score in the final seconds of an excruciating 12-7 loss in prime time. ""We always get told that 'we're almost there, we're almost there,' "" Fields said . ""Me, personally, I'm tired of being almost there. I'm tired of being just this close.â Fieldsâ frustration is beyond understandable for a Bears team that had three trips inside Commanders territory that produced zero points. Chicago is taking baby steps, but it wasnât enough on Thursday."
2022,7,30,Washington Commanders,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Commanders didnât play particularly well on Thursday night, but sometimes you can win simply by letting the other team beat itself. Thatâs how it felt after two crucial Bears blunders in the second half -- a muffed punt and goal-line bobble -- allowed Washington to escape Soldier Field with a 12-7 win . With Carson Wentz expected to be sidelined for four-to-six weeks after fracturing the ring finger on his throwing hand against Chicago, the Commanders will turn to Taylor Heinicke when they host the Packers on Sunday."
2022,7,31,Houston Texans,1-3-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 The Texans ended their bye week with a major organizational shakeup. The team parted ways with executive vice president of football operations Jack Easterby, a former team chaplain turned front-office executive who rose to a high position of influence after Houston fired former coach and GM Bill OâBrien four games into the 2020 season. This news was not met with sorrow from a large portion of the fan base. Meanwhile, Texans fans must hope a better version of Davis Mills shows up after the bye: The second-year QB has finished with a passer rating under 100 in all five games."
2022,7,32,Carolina Panthers,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Panthers look very much like a team ready for the end of the season. This is bad news, especially when itâs the middle of October. Steve Wilksâ tenure as interim coach began with a 24-10 loss to the Rams that will be remembered for Wilks sending Robbie Anderson to the locker room (and into Panthers history, as it turns out) after the mercurial wide receiver got into multiple sideline disagreements with his positional coach. On Monday, Anderson was traded to the Cardinals. Could Christian McCaffrey be next ?"
2022,8,1,Buffalo Bills,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 Josh Allen comes out of the Week 7 bye as a strong contender -- and perhaps the early favorite -- in the NFL MVP race. Allen was once again locked in during Week 6's massive conference showdown with the Chiefs at Arrowhead, throwing for 329 yards and three touchdowns in a 24-20 win . He was the only QB to have three games with 300 yards and at least three passing scores in the season's first six weeks. As has been the case for most of the season, Allen was largely unstoppable when attacking defenses downfield: According to Next Gen Stats, Allen went 9-for-10 with 204 yards, three scores and a perfect passer rating of 158.3 on throws of at least 15 air yards against Kansas City. Dominance against elite competition is the stuff of MVPs."
2022,8,2,Philadelphia Eagles,6-0,"Previous rank: No. 2 If this Eagles season ends in another Lombardi celebration, it should be the late-summer trade for defensive back C.J. Gardner-Johnson that earns general manager Howie Roseman the most credit. Gardner-Johnson -- acquired from the Saints on roster cutdown day for a couple Day 3 draft picks -- has been a producer in the Philadelphia secondary and one of the team's vocal and charismatic leaders. Gardner-Johnson picked off Cooper Rush twice in the Week 6 win over the Cowboys that sent Philly into its bye as football's only undefeated team. The Eagles sit at plus-12 in turnover differential, by far the best figure in the league."
2022,8,3,Kansas City Chiefs,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 You are never out of a game when Patrick Mahomes is your quarterback. Mahomes wiped out a double-digit deficit in a 44-23 pasting of the 49ers on Sunday, the latest example of no lead being safe against the Chiefs. From the NFL Media Research Department: Mahomes is 12-5 in games in which he trails by 10 or more points since 2019 (including playoffs). No other QB even has a winning record in those games. A big reason for this statistical anomaly: the team's ability to hit on chunk plays. K.C. has a league-best 22 receptions of 25 or more yards this season, up from 14 such catches over the same span a year ago. The Chiefs traded Tyreek Hill away and got more explosive. Go figure."
2022,8,4,Dallas Cowboys,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 6 These Cowboys feel more dangerous because their success or failure won't solely rely on a high-profile offense being asked to rise to the occasion when it counts. Teams built to win shootouts can be exposed in the postseason -- but a team with a dominant defense? That will travel into January and perhaps beyond. We saw that again on Sunday at Jerrah World, where the Cowboys' D again carried the day with five turnovers that led to 21 points in a 24-6 win over the Lions. The heavy lifting on Dan Quinn's side of the ball allowed Dak Prescott (19 of 25, 207 yards, TD) to gently ease himself back into the mix after missing five weeks with a thumb injury. Prescott will only improve with more reps, making the Cowboys a well-rounded contender on the level of the Eagles."
2022,8,5,Cincinnati Bengals,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 Joe Burrow is cooking now. The third-year QB looks about ready to dip his toe in the MVP discussion after a masterful performance in a blowout win over the Falcons. Burrow passed for 344 yards in the first half alone as the Bengals scored on their first four possessions. When it was over, Burrow had become the first player in NFL history to have five 400-yard passing games in his first three seasons. Cincy has come a long way since the robust struggles that defined the start of its AFC title defense. ""Well,"" Zac Taylor said, ""I hope you all listened to me as I got up here at 0-2 and said just be patient."" Fair play, coach!"
2022,8,6,New York Giants,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Giants have a knack for winning close games -- a massive attribute in a league where it seems like nearly every team hovers around the same level in terms of talent and potential. Big Blue was in closer mode again on Sunday, getting a stop at the goal line as time expired to outlast the Jaguars . Daniel Jones went over 100 yards on the ground, and Saquon Barkley continued to dominate, putting the Jacksonville defense on skates with 72 of his 110 rushing yards in the final quarter. Weird-stat-in-a-weird-season alert: The Giants are 6-1 despite being the only team in the NFL without a receiver who's surpassed 200 yards on the season."
2022,8,7,Minnesota Vikings,5-1,"Previous rank: No. 4 The quiet of a Vikings bye week feels like a good time to examine the historic start to Justin Jefferson 's career. The third-year wideout had yet another 100-yard effort in Week 6's win over the Dolphins , and will enter Week 8 averaging the most yards per game for a wide receiver in NFL history. Jefferson averages 94.1 yards per game, which puts him ahead of Julio Jones (91.2) and Calvin Johnson (86.1). Jefferson also has the third-most 100-yard games through three seasons, dating back to at least 1950: Only Randy Moss (19) and Odell Beckham Jr. (19) are ahead of him. Jefferson, of course, has 11 more games to set that record, too. Pretty heady stuff for a 23-year-old."
2022,8,8,Baltimore Ravens,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 It wasn't a thing of beauty -- and it featured another big scare after Baltimore built a double-digit lead in the second half -- but the Ravens found their way back to the win column with a 23-20 victory over the Browns. Lamar Jackson 's recent play continues to profile as a curiosity: The quarterback has looked tentative in the pocket since a blazing-hot start, managing just three touchdown passes against four interceptions in the last four games. Jackson has kept his game afloat thanks to his legs. His 510 rushing yards through seven games top the entirety of the Buccaneers (451) and Rams (423)."
2022,8,9,Tennessee Titans,4-2,"Previous rank: No. 14 The 0-2 start feels like a long time ago. The Titans completed a season sweep of the Colts and inadvertently ended the Matt Ryan era in Indianapolis with a 19-10 win at Nissan Stadium. That's four straight wins for Mike Vrabel's team, which has a nice lead in the moribund AFC South. Derrick Henry delivered another 100-yard game, while the Colts' pass rush harassed Ryan for three sacks and the pressure that produced the game-defining pick-six by safety Andrew Adams . The Titans don't bring a lot of sizzle to the proceedings, but they appear engineered for 11 or 12 wins in the current NFL climate."
2022,8,10,New York Jets,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Jets have won five of their first seven games for the first time in 12 years, but well-earned optimism was tempered by crushing disappointment after a 16-9 win over the Broncos at Mile High. Running back Breece Hall -- edging into the Rookie Sensation category after a 62-yard touchdown run to open the scoring Sunday -- had his hugely promising debut season end in an instant with a torn ACL. A calamitous first half also included a season-ending triceps injury to versatile blocker Alijah Vera-Tucker , another emerging star. The loss of the team's top running back and best offensive lineman significantly amps up the pressure on inconsistent second-year passer Zach Wilson , even if you factor in Monday's trade with the Jaguars for veteran back James Robinson . Long-suffering Jets fans deserve a better fate."
2022,8,11,Los Angeles Rams,3-3,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Rams might have come up short in their pursuit of Christian McCaffrey during the Week 7 bye, but they can find some solace in the possible emergence of Allen Robinson . The veteran wide receiver, invisible for much of the season's first six weeks after a summer of breathless hype, finally made an impact in Week 6's win over the Panthers . Robinson finished that game with six targets, five catches, 63 yards and a touchdown -- all season highs for him. Matthew Stafford 's struggle this year stems in some part from an inability to identify playmakers he can trust aside from Cooper Kupp . The emergence of some chemistry between the QB and Robinson could be a game-changer for Sean McVay."
2022,8,12,San Francisco 49ers,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 The 49ers have a shiny new toy at running back in Christian McCaffrey -- unfortunately, CMC can't be of service to the defense. San Francisco was outclassed by Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, who rolled up 529 yards at 9.1 yards per play in a 44-23 stomping at Levi's Stadium. An avalanche of injuries helps to explain how the defense has sunk into mediocrity in recent weeks, and it puts more pressure on the offense to pick up the slack. Sunday returns were not good: Too many field goals (along with a crushing red-zone interception by Jimmy Garoppolo ) was the recipe for a blowout loss. Expect a settled McCaffrey to have a much larger role in the attack moving forward."
2022,8,13,Las Vegas Raiders,2-4,"Previous rank: No. 16 Josh Jacobs looked like he was soon to be a part of the Raiders' past when the organization declined his fifth-year option in April . Fast-forward to October, and the running back looks like a key piece of the team's future. Jacobs continued his team MVP act on Sunday, rushing for 143 yards and three TDs in a massively important win over the Texans . It's his second multi-score game of the season and third consecutive 100-yard effort on the ground. When the Raiders traded for Davante Adams , Josh McDaniels had the parts to an offense that would do most of its damage through the air. Jacobs' resurrection has flipped the script."
2022,8,14,Miami Dolphins,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 23 Tua Tagovailoa returned, and the Dolphins got back to winning -- but that feels more like a coincidence than cause and effect. Tua played like an extremely rusty quarterback against the Steelers; several near-interceptions would have been turned over if Pittsburgh defenders had better hands. Miami triumphed because its defense put the clamps on Kenny Pickett , forcing the struggling rookie into a pair of fourth-quarter red-zone picks that salted away the victory. A tasty Week 8 matchup against the scuffling Lions' defense could be just what the offense needs."
2022,8,15,Seattle Seahawks,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 20 It was Next Man Up after running back Rashaad Penny went down for the year with a broken leg, and Kenneth Walker III is that Man. The rookie ran all over the Chargers in a 37-23 win , piling up 168 yards on the ground, including the game-clinching 74-yard jaunt in the fourth quarter. It was another banner day for the most surprising offense in the NFL: Geno Smith threw two more touchdown passes as Seattle rolled up 404 total yards. The Seahawks reach Week 8 all alone atop the NFC West. Tell me you predicted it, and I'll tell you you're a liar."
2022,8,16,Los Angeles Chargers,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 10 The familiar funk of disappointment is encircling the Chargers once again. The Seahawks came to SoFi Stadium and dropped a hammer on the hosts, attacking L.A. on the ground and through the air in a 37-23 blowout . The game was costly from a health standpoint , as well: Mike Williams is facing a multi-week absence after suffering a high ankle sprain, while J.C. Jackson 's cursed debut season with the Bolts is over after he suffered a serious knee injury . Throw in some curiously uninspired play from Justin Herbert (4.9 yards per attempt in his past 108 attempts), and Brandon Staley has a lot of work to do during the Week 8 bye."
2022,8,17,New England Patriots,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Patriots got blown out of their own building by the Bears on Monday Night Football , and Bill Belichick might live to regret the can of worms he just opened. The iconic head coach, who entered Week 7 tied with George Halas for second on the all-time wins board, yanked Mac Jones out of the lineup just three possessions into his return from a high ankle sprain . Enter Bailey Zappe , who was greeted with a huge ovation and led New England on two quick touchdown drives before the offense stalled out again. Did Zappe do enough to stay in the lineup, or will Jones get another chance Sunday against the Jets ? New England sports talk radio will be louder than usual."
2022,8,18,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ Everything is going wrong for the Bucs right now. The offense can't score, the defense can't get a stop, and the losses continue to pile up. That's four in five weeks for Tampa Bay after Sunday's stunning 21-3 defeat to a Panthers team that all but announced it was folding up the tent on the season with its Thursday trade of star running back Christian McCaffrey . The symbolic failure of the day belongs to Mike Evans , a franchise cornerstone and perhaps the most consistent producer in team history, who dropped a wide-open touchdown pass on the third play from scrimmage. The frustration only built from there. The lone positive? The NFC South is a total mess: At 3-4, the Bucs somehow maintain possession of a tie for first place."
2022,8,19,Green Bay Packers,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 At a certain point, you are what you are -- and the Packers are a team with an average offense. This seems impossible when back-to-back reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers is in the building, but Green Bay continues to be hamstrung by a passing game thatâs unable to sustain any level of momentum. It doesnât help that Matt LaFleur remains allergic to simply driving the attack through his twin engine running backs, Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon . LaFleurâs decision to call for a pass on a critical fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter of Sundayâs loss to the Commanders tells the story of a play-caller who remains too stubborn in his scheme. Rookie wideout Romeo Doubs dropped the ball ... but so did his head coach."
2022,8,20,Arizona Cardinals,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Cardinals profile as the type of struggling team that could benefit from a good old-fashioned sideline dustup. They received one on Thursday night, when Kyler Murray got into an animated back-and-forth with head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Both men downplayed the heated exchange after the game, a 42-34 win that brought some calm to the desert. The Arizona offense showed some signs of life, helped significantly by the return of DeAndre Hopkins from suspension . The three-time All-Pro wideout -- who only logged his first practice of the season on Tuesday -- stepped in and immediately delivered a 10-catch, 100-yard effort. Said Kingsbury: âI don't know where he's been or what he's been doing, but it worked.â"
2022,8,21,New Orleans Saints,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 19 A season high on promise is suddenly on the brink. The Saints lost for the fifth time in seven tries on Thursday night, an ugly 42-34 setback that included two Andy Dalton pick-sixes and generally uninspired play against a middling Cardinals team. Alvin Kamara spoke in the locker room after the loss, preaching accountability for the avalanche of mistakes that have haunted New Orleans. The Saints have committed the second-highest number of penalties in football, with a league-worst turnover differential. None of this is a good look for head coach Dennis Allen, who is not making anyone forget about Sean Payton."
2022,8,22,Atlanta Falcons,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 18 There is perhaps no team in football less schematically inclined to play from behind than the Atlanta Falcons. Arthur Smithâs bunch trailed by double digits for the final 50 minutes of play on Sunday against the Bengals, but still somehow ended the game with only 13 pass attempts. This is curious and a bit disturbing when you consider the Falcons invested top-10 picks in the past two seasons on wide receiver Drake London and tight end Kyle Pitts . It creates a strange dynamic in which the teamâs offensive philosophies (run first, run forever) do not appear to be aligned with the organizationâs roster building."
2022,8,23,Chicago Bears,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 29 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Justin Fields took a huge step in his development on Monday Night Football . The second-year passer went into a hostile road environment and didn't blink, delivering with his arm and legs in a blowout win over Bill Belichick and the Patriots. The Bears' offense was relentless -- rolling up 243 yards on the ground with 11 third-down conversions, their most in a game since 2015. The defense was equally up to the task, sending an ineffective Mac Jones to the bench after just three possessions before pitching a shutout in the second half. Bears back? Maybe."
2022,8,24,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 22 Mike Tomlin has famously never had a losing season in his 16-year run as head coach of the Steelers, but that historic streak appears destined to end as Pittsburgh rides the ebbs and flows of life with a rookie quarterback. Kenny Pickett struggled to finish drives in Sunday nightâs 16-10 loss to the Dolphins, throwing a pair of interceptions in Dolphins territory that buried a Steelers team which needs to maximize every scoring opportunity it has. Putting Pickett back on the bench has to be tempting for Tomlin, especially after Mitch Trubisky came to the rescue in Pittsburgh's Week 6 win over the Buccaneers. Staying with the rookie makes sense in the long term -- but does Tomlin have the stomach for the growing pains that are sure to continue? Stay tuned."
2022,8,25,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 25 For the Browns to return to the playoffs, it was imperative they get out of the first 12 games of the season in decent shape ahead of Deshaun Watson 's debut. That's looking increasingly unlikely as Cleveland continues to be on the wrong end of agonizing losses. The latest: a 23-20 setback to the Ravens that featured a go-ahead touchdown pass to Amari Cooper wiped away by penalty and a false start on a game-tying field-goal try that forced Cade York to attempt a 60-yarder ( blocked , naturally). The Browns will drag a four-game losing streak into a Monday Night Football matchup with the surging Bengals . Ominous vibes in Cleveland."
2022,8,26,Indianapolis Colts,3-3-1,"Previous rank: No. 21 Andrew Luck to Jacoby Brissett to Philip Rivers to Carson Wentz to Matt Ryan ... to Sam Ehlinger ? In a stunning turn of events, the Colts announced Monday that Ryan will be benched for the duration of the season in favor of Ehlinger, a preseason superstar with zero career starts. Ryan certainly earned a benching with his leaden, turnover-prone play, but parachuting out of the latest expensive-veteran-QB gamble after just seven games begs some very important questions about who is actually running the show in Indy. It goes without saying that both GM Chris Ballard and coach Frank Reich stand on very shaky ground."
2022,8,27,Denver Broncos,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 24 Different quarterback, same results. The Broncos find their season slipping away because an elite defense is being let down every week by an unimaginative offense and subpar quarterback play. Brett Rypien -- making the start against the Jets after Russell Wilson was scratched with a partially torn hamstring -- averaged fewer than 5 yards per attempt on 46 throws and was unable to lead Denver on a touchdown drive despite New York's own sputtering attack providing numerous opportunities. If thereâs any good news for the rest of us, Rypienâs pedestrian effort will spare everyone talk of a quarterback controversy in Denver. This is Wilsonâs ship, sinking though it may be. UPDATE: On Friday, Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett said Russell Wilson will return to the starting lineup , barring a setback, for Sunday's game against the Jaguars in London."
2022,8,28,Washington Commanders,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 30 How about we dole out some deserved love to the eternally overlooked Terry McLaurin ? The fourth-year wide receiver hasnât been given much of an opportunity to fill up the box score this season, but he stepped up huge in Washingtonâs 23-21 win over the Packers. McLaurin hauled in Taylor Heinicke's go-ahead touchdown pass in the third quarter before essentially sealing the game with two massive first-down receptions on the Commandersâ final possession. Consecutive victories have put Washington back in the mix, style points be damned. ""You can win pretty; you can win ugly,"" coach Ron Rivera said postgame. ""If you're going to win ugly, who cares?"""
2022,8,29,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Travis Etienne Show is officially streaming on all formats. The 2021 first-round pick announced his arrival on Sunday, piling up 114 yards on 8.1 yards per carry and his first career touchdown in a narrow loss to the Giants. Etienne was already in line for a bigger role after his breakout performance, but that became official after NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday that the Jaguars are trading running back James Robinson to the Jets for a conditional Day 3 draft pick. Robinson, a fan favorite in Jacksonville and source of rich drama due to his lack of playing time under Urban Meyer, averaged 4.2 yards per carry with three touchdowns in seven games (five starts) this season."
2022,8,30,Carolina Panthers,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 32 Life without Christian McCaffrey began with an unexpected treat. The running backs tasked with replacing the superstar piled up 176 yards on the ground in an upset win over Tom Brady and the Buccaneers. Plenty of credit is due to Steve Wilks, the interim head coach who had his team playing hard even when it's apparent the organization has already flipped the page to 2023. ""That definitely wasn't a team out there that was trying to tank it,"" Wilks said . ""These guys right here have come together and they believe in one another. ... There is a lot that we can build on today."""
2022,8,31,Detroit Lions,1-5,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Lions returned to competitive football after their pre-bye thumping in Foxborough , but the results remain the same for the Fightin' Campbells. Five second-half turnovers by the offense were too much to overcome in a 24-6 loss to the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. The cruelest giveaway? A goal-line fumble by Jamaal Williams when Detroit appeared poised to take a lead in the fourth quarter. ""I'm frustrated because we're losing, just like I was last year,"" Campbell said. ""But I'm not down, I'm not losing confidence. I'm not going to go hide in a corner."" A fact the coach might want to hide under a Honolulu blue rug at team headquarters: The Lions fell to 4-18-1 in his tenure."
2022,8,32,Houston Texans,1-4-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 Another week, another loss for the Texans, but head coach Lovie Smith can at least point to some positives on the offensive side of the ball. Quarterback Davis Mills enjoyed his best game of the season, going over 300 yards through the air with a pair of scoring tosses. His outing wasn't perfect -- a late pick-six sealed the game for the Raiders when Houston was still in striking distance -- but Mills put the ball on his receivers throughout the day and improved his accuracy considerably (68 percent completion rate, about six percentage points higher than the mark he'd put together in the previous five games). It's a start."
2022,9,1,Buffalo Bills,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Bills cruised past the Packers in prime time, and it was again Stefon Diggs leading the way on offense . The star wideout posted his third consecutive 100-yard game with a touchdown catch in a 27-17 win in Orchard Park. Buffalo is invincible when Diggs gets his: The Bills have won 11 straight when their No. 1 wideout crosses the receiving century mark. Diggsâ big day served as cover for an attack that struggled when the ball went in different directions on Sunday night: Josh Allen connected on just 7 of 17 attempts for a touchdown and two picks when not targeting Diggs."
2022,9,2,Philadelphia Eagles,7-0,"Previous rank: No. 2 We are eight weeks into the season, and the Eagles have yet to trail in the second half of a game. Philly was in the zone once again on Sunday, attacking an overmatched Pittsburgh secondary through the air in a 35-13 win at the Linc. The receiving star was A.J. Brown , who had three first-half touchdowns and very nearly added a fourth before his monster afternoon was through. Jalen Hurts , meanwhile, continued to build on his increasingly compelling MVP case with a career-high four passing scores while throwing for 10.2 yards per attempt. With an upcoming schedule that includes the Texans (1-5-1) , Commanders (4-4) and Colts (3-4-1) ,, the runway is clear for 10-0. Someone wake up Mercury Morris ."
2022,9,3,Kansas City Chiefs,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 The Chiefs stayed busy during their bye week, pulling the trigger on a trade that sent a third-round compensatory pick and a sixth-rounder to the Giants for Kadarius Toney , a 2021 first-round pick with star potential but plenty of question marks. A hamstring issue has kept Toney sidelined since Week 2, but he flashed elite traits as a run-after-catch receiver in his rookie season in New York. Itâs telling how a new Giants regime found a recent first-round pick like Toney so instantly expendable, but itâs also understandable why Kansas City decided to roll the dice. Toneyâs talent could translate beautifully in an offense run by Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes ."
2022,9,4,Dallas Cowboys,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 4 The Cowboys' defense carried the team when Dak Prescott was on the shelf with a busted thumb. As a long season winds on, perhaps weâre now starting to see a reversal of roles. The previously stingy Dallas D was gashed for 240 yards on the ground by Chicago, but Prescott and the Cowboys' attack was outstanding in a 49-29 win at Jerrah World. Dallas scored touchdowns on its first four possessions for the first time in eight years, while Prescott and Tony Pollard (three total touchdowns each) powered an offense that overwhelmed an inferior opponent. If the Cowboys can sync up both sides of the ball, there are few teams who can even hang with them."
2022,9,5,San Francisco 49ers,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 12 All the pundits who criticized the 49ersâ trade for Christian McCaffrey got real quiet on Sunday. CMC became the first running back since 2005 -- and just the third since 1970 -- to register a rushing touchdown, receiving touchdown and passing score in the same game, a 31-14 beatdown of the Rams at SoFi Stadium. The Niners continue to dominate their rivalry with the defending Super Bowl champions: San Francisco has now won eight consecutive games over the Rams in the regular season. A narrow loss in the 2021 NFC Championship Game canât be overlooked, but the 49ers clearly appear to be the better, more complete team right now."
2022,9,6,Baltimore Ravens,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 The magic of Lamar Jackson is undeniable. The former MVP took over in the second half of a 27-22 win over the Buccaneers on Thursday night, putting the home team away by leading four consecutive scoring drives after halftime. With momentum on the season building, Ravens GM Eric DeCosta pulled the trigger Monday on a trade with the Bears that brought standout linebacker Roquan Smith to Baltimore. Smith, the league's leading tackler, represents an upgrade on inconsistent former first-round pick Patrick Queen while also serving as a clear signal from the front office to the locker room: The Ravens are in it to win it in 2022."
2022,9,7,Minnesota Vikings,6-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 Patrick Peterson waited a long time to get his opportunity for revenge on the Cardinals. And while the veteran cornerback didn't snag the two interceptions he'd promised all week against his former team, he was active and extremely engaged throughout Sunday's 34-26 win , Minnesota's sixth in seven tries this season. ""I'm still waiting on (general manager) Steve Keim to call me,"" said Peterson, who left the Cardinals after the 2020 season. ""Still haven't talked to him."" The Vikings never seem to win comfortably, but they've opened up a comfortable lead over the Packers and Bears in the otherwise-scuffling NFC North."
2022,9,8,Tennessee Titans,5-2,"Previous rank: No. 9 Letâs take a moment here to try to contextualize the unrivaled greatness of Derrick Henry . The superstar running back did it again on Sunday, tallying his fourth consecutive 200-yard rushing effort against the Texans in a 17-10 win . Henryâs latest feat is more impressive when you factor in that he did it without Ryan Tannehill , the ever-steady quarterback whose absence meant the Titans would have almost no ability to move the ball through the air with rookie Malik Willis making his starting debut. The Texans knew Henry was getting the ball on nearly every snap and they still couldnât stop him. The King is the rarest of professional athletes: The player who can impose his will upon a helpless opponent."
2022,9,9,Seattle Seahawks,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Seahawks continued their surge on Sunday, leaning on a suddenly stout defense in concert with more steady production from Geno Smith and the offense in a 27-13 win over the Giants at a frenzied Lumen Field. Much credit for Seattle's rise is due to Pete Carroll, who absolutely should be seen as a favorite for Coach of the Year honors. Carroll empowered Smith from the moment Russell Wilson was traded, putting his trust in a journeyman quarterback who has rewarded his coach's faith. Then there's the defensive side of the ball -- Carroll's specialty -- which has stacked three consecutive weeks of strong play after a woeful start to the season. These Seahawks are for real."
2022,9,10,Cincinnati Bengals,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ Life without Ja'Marr Chase did not begin well. The Bengals were completely flummoxed by a Browns defense that's struggled mightily for most of the season in a 32-13 loss on Halloween night. Joe Burrow salvaged his night statistically with two fourth-quarter touchdown passes, but Cincinnati had no answers when the game was still in the balance. The defense -- which entered Monday having not allowed a touchdown in the second half all season -- surrendered back-to-back scores to begin the third quarter, putting the contest out of reach. A ""Bury The Ball"" game is not the preferred way to head into November."
2022,9,11,New York Giants,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 6 The Giants found themselves in yet another tight game in the fourth quarter, but this time, the results were not what they hoped for. Seattle's defense put the clamps on Saquon Barkley , while New York's defense couldn't get a big stop in the final minutes of a 27-13 loss at Lumen Field. Big Blue managed just 225 yards of total offense and scored its lone touchdown on a drive that started at the Seattle 2-yard line after a Tyler Lockett fumble . Concerns about the aptitude of the Giants' attack against better competition is warranted, but New York remains well set up as we look ahead. The G-Men get their bye this week before matchups against the Texans and Lions -- arguably the two worst teams in football (see below!)."
2022,9,12,Miami Dolphins,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Dolphins have a healthy quarterback and seem to have rediscovered their happy place. Miami won for the second straight week, piling up 476 yards of offense in a 31-27 victory over the Lions at Ford Field. We suspected Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle would create a nightmare scenario for defensive coordinators, but this is just ridiculous: Hill and Waddle have combined for 1,688 receiving yards in the first seven games of 2022, the most by a teammate duo in the first eight games of the Super Bowl era. Hill is on pace for 2,042 yards, which would shatter the all-time single season mark currently held by Hall of Fame Lions wideout Calvin Johnson (1,964 yards in 2012). As for Waddle? He's on pace for 1,545 yards and 11 touchdowns. Slacker."
2022,9,13,New England Patriots,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 17 With the benefit of hindsight, Sundayâs result makes way more sense. Bill Belichick and the Patriots had just been embarrassed at home by the Bears on a prime-time stage -- they couldn't ask for a better tonic than getting the Jets six days later. The Pats continued to pick on their own personal Charlie Brown, bullying an overmatched Zach Wilson into three interceptions in a 22-17 win at the Meadowlands. New England has now beaten New York 13 straight times -- tied for the longest active streak among division rivals. Questions will continue to persist at quarterback -- Mac Jones remained uninspiring in the win -- but the Pats can thank the Jets for once again providing a soft landing in times of turbulence."
2022,9,14,New York Jets,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Jets had a huge opportunity on Sunday, a chance to finally gain an upper hand over the vulnerable Patriots and show the football world, their fans and themselves that New Englandâs two-decade run of dominance in this rivalry was a thing of the past. It was an opportunity lost . The Jetsâ four-game winning streak was unceremoniously halted by the Belichicks, and the fan base woke up Monday morning wondering if it's trapped rooting for another high-profile young QB who's in over his head . ""We've got faith in Z,â said Robert Saleh after Zach Wilson âs three-interception crumble. The coach is putting on a brave face -- but a flop on that stage can allow doubt to creep into a locker room."
2022,9,15,Los Angeles Rams,3-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Rams have played like a mediocre team all year, and at some point, we might have to accept thatâs what they are. The defending champs got thumped at home by the rival 49ers, a 31-14 loss that leaves no doubt which of these teams is more likely to make a Super Bowl push in the season's second half. Adding salt to the wound was a dominant performance by Christian McCaffrey -- the running back Los Angeles coveted ahead of his trade to San Francisco -- who notched three touchdowns (one each as a rusher, receiver and passer). If you listened closely enough, you could almost hear Sean McVay's internal monologue: "" Oh, come on ."""
2022,9,16,Los Angeles Chargers,4-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Chargers had a bye week to figure out how to make their underperforming offense explosive again. Cracking that mystery has been further complicated by the news star wide receiver Mike Williams -- L.A.âs best big-play threat -- will be out multiple weeks with a high ankle sprain. When you factor in Williamsâ absence with Keenan Allen âs season-long odyssey to shake a hamstring issue, it makes sense for Bolts GM Tom Telesco to target a wide receiver ahead of the Tuesday trade deadline . If Telesco stands pat, a playmaker must emerge from within."
2022,9,17,New Orleans Saints,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Saints are one of the NFL's genuine mystery teams as we spin toward the season's second half. The good version of Dennis Allen's bunch showed up on Sunday, beating up on the Raiders on both sides of the ball in a 24-0 win . The star of the day was Alvin Kamara , who scored three touchdowns a little over a week after he gave a passionate speech to teammates imploring the Saints to play up to their potential. ""I stick to what I said,"" Kamara said after the shutout. ""We was going to go out there and beat their ass, and we did that."""
2022,9,18,Atlanta Falcons,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 22 The benefits of having Younghoe Koo and not Eddy PiÃ±eiro cannot be overstated. The ever-dependable Koo booted a 41-yard field goal in overtime after two misses by PiÃ±eiro gave the Falcons extended life in a 37-34 victory . ""Our guys don't blink,"" quarterback Marcus Mariota said after a wild win that nearly became a loss when Atlantaâs decimated secondary allowed D.J. Moore to haul in a 62-yard TD in the final seconds of regulation. Mariota had two interceptions in the game, but also threw for three touchdowns and completed 12 straight passes at one point. It was nice to see Arthur Smith give his veteran quarterback a chance to make some plays with his arm after weeks of run-dominant game scripts."
2022,9,19,Green Bay Packers,3-5,Previous rank: No. 19 The kind viewpoint would be that Sunday nightâs 27-17 loss to the Bills represented progress on some level. Many predicted Green Bay would get embarrassed on the road in prime time against the best team in football -- and that didnât happen. Then thereâs the howling outside criticism connected to a season-long reticence to lean on the running game -- Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon nearly went over 200 yards combined in Buffalo. But this season opened as a Super Bowl-or-bust proposition in Green Bay. Any legitimate optimism borne out of being marginally competitive against the Bills shows just how far these Packers have careened off the tracks.
2022,9,20,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 18 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ It's just not getting better. The Bucs lost for the fifth time in six weeks on Thursday night , a prime-time stumble that put the spotlight on just how much has gone wrong for the defending NFC South champs. The defense is vulnerable: zero turnovers in four games, and 204 rushing yards surrendered to the Ravens in the second half. But the focus after the loss was on the offense, and specifically Tom Brady , the legendary quarterback who played his worst game of the season. ""He's the best to ever do it,"" said teammate Mike Evans . ""I mean, he hates losing. That's all he knows is winning, and being 3-5 is not good enough, so we've gotta turn it around and soon."""
2022,9,21,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 25 ï»¿ Where has this version of the defense been all season? Joe Woods' beleaguered crew played like demons on Halloween night, shutting down Joe Burrow and Co. until the game was far out of reach in a 32-13 win in Cleveland. While the defense finally played up to expectations, Jacoby Brissett had all day to work behind an offensive line that dominated in all phases. According to Next Gen Stats, Brissett had an average of 3.24 seconds to throw per pass in another efficient performance. Nick Chubb isn't a player who needs much help at all, adding two more touchdowns on the ground in what's been a quietly dominant season. The Browns put themselves in a hole, but they have the talent to dig out."
2022,9,22,Arizona Cardinals,3-5,Previous rank: No. 20 We continue to see sloppy play from the Cardinals week after week. The fourth quarter of Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Vikings was a clinic in dysfunction. The final five possessions included: A red-zone miscommunication on third down that led to a shotgun snap fired off Kyler Murray 's left arm. A muffed punt by Greg Dortch that led to Minnesota's final touchdown. A Murray interception on a late throw over the middle. A Murray pass short of the sticks on fourth-and-4. A blind-side block personal foul by Eno Benjamin that doomed a frantic final drive in the closing seconds. Arizona's issues are systemic.
2022,9,23,Las Vegas Raiders,2-5,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Raiders were shut out for the first time in eight years on Sunday, a 24-0 blanking at the hands of the Saints that invites questions about the direction of the organization under first-year coach Josh McDaniels. After the game, and after another reported meeting with team owner Mark Davis ( the second in as many months), McDaniels stood behind the podium at the Superdome and took ownership for what just happened. ""I apologize to Raider Nation for that performance and, again, I own that,"" McDaniels said. ""If you're going to point a finger, point it at me. Obviously, I need to do a better job of getting us ready on game day."" The last-place Raiders are among the biggest disappointments in football at the season's near midpoint."
2022,9,24,Chicago Bears,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 23 The Bears enjoyed the most impressive win of their season just over a week ago in New England, but that already seems like decades ago in the Windy City. Last Wednesday, Chicago traded star pass rusher Robert Quinn to the Eagles. On Sunday, the Bears were overwhelmed by the Cowboys in a 49-29 loss at Jerrah World. Then came Monday, and the news the team had sent star linebacker Roquan Smith to the Ravens in exchange for draft picks. GM Ryan Poles' decision to sell at the deadline shows a commitment to a complete teardown in Chicago. It's a full-measure method that -- if done right -- can return the storied franchise to prominence, but patience will be essential for an already-beleaguered fanbase. UPDATE: Turns out the Bears are sellers and buyers. Poles made a move to help Justin Fields ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline, acquiring wide receiver Chase Claypool in a deal with the Steelers ."
2022,9,25,Washington Commanders,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Washington Commanders are scrappy as hell. Ron Riveraâs motley bunch found a way once again on Sunday, getting a Taylor Heinicke QB sneak touchdown with 22 seconds remaining to steal a 17-16 win away from the Colts. Itâs Washingtonâs third straight win, pulling them back to .500 and into the playoff race of the unsettled NFC. The vibes are much improved in Landover, but the cruel crush of reality feels imminent: Washingtonâs next two opponents -- the Vikings and Eagles -- have a combined record of 13-1. Find a way to sneak out of that dastardly doubleheader with a win, and weâll see the Commanders as true players in the wild-card hunt."
2022,9,26,Denver Broncos,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Broncos are not fixed â¦ far from it. But itâs hard to overstate how important Sundayâs 21-17 win was for a team that feels like itâs been teetering on the edge of the cliff since Week 1. Russell Wilson delivered another deeply inconsistent performance in his return from a hamstring injury, but he deserves credit for the deep strike to KJ Hamler that kick-started an 80-yard touchdown drive in the final two minutes. When cornerback K'Waun Williams sealed the game minutes later with a diving interception , you could hear the organizational exhale from London. Under new ownership and at the helm of one of footballâs most disappointing teams, Nathaniel Hackett has to be feeling some heat under his seat. This was a desperately needed victory."
2022,9,27,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Steelers weren't ready for that smoke. A young Pittsburgh team went to Philadelphia and found itself overmatched in a 35-13 loss that could have been a lot worse if the Eagles kept their foot on the accelerator in the second half. Minkah Fitzpatrick and the secondary were humbled, as Eagles star A.J. Brown collected three long touchdown receptions in the first half alone. With Pittsburgh's playoff chances fading by the week, it will be interesting to see if the team shifts into a more conservative approach in regard to T.J. Watt . The reigning Defensive Player of the Year has been on injured reserve since Week 1 with a torn pectoral muscle."
2022,9,28,Indianapolis Colts,3-4-1,"Previous rank: No. 26 New quarterback, similar results for the Colts, who donât score enough points to win on a regular basis. Sam Ehlinger avoided the disastrous mistakes that pock-marked Matt Ryan âs short run as QB1, throwing for 201 yards on 17-of-23 passing, but the Colts scored one touchdown or fewer for the fourth time in eight weeks. Itâs a chronic lack of production that allows a mediocre team like the Commanders to sneak out of Lucas Oil Stadium with a 17-16 win . âI know we didn't gain, like, a thousand yards or anything like that, but I felt today we could find a rhythm with what we have out there,"" head coach Frank Reich said Sunday . ""I felt today that we can put something together and continue to get better.â Reich better hope so -- his job likely depends on it. UPDATE: On Tuesday, the Colts announced that they have fired offensive coordinator Marcus Brady ."
2022,9,29,Carolina Panthers,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 30 You might not find a more cruel defeat all season. The Panthers tied the Falcons with a miracle D.J. Moore touchdown in the final seconds, but a missed Eddy PiÃ±eiro extra point (made considerably more challenging by Mooreâs post-score exuberance ) was followed by a chip-shot field-goal miss in overtime in a 37-34 defeat . The blood-curdling setback cost Carolina a share of first place in the absurd NFC South. On the positive side, P.J. Walker played well in his second start and will get the nod next Sunday , even with Sam Darnold (ankle) finally expected to make his return to the active roster. Itâs looking increasingly possible Baker Mayfield has already played his last snap in Charlotte."
2022,9,30,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 29 Russell Wilson picked himself off the mat on Sunday and led the Broncos on a go-ahead touchdown drive against the Jaguars with 1:47 to play. When it was Trevor Lawrence âs turn to put on the cape, it just turned into more disappointment for Jacksonville. Lawrence was picked off on his first throw in the ensuing drive, sealing a painful 21-17 loss at Wembley Stadium. Lawrence, who also threw a critical end-zone interception on first-and-goal at the 1-yard line in the first half, is not making the strides many expected. His starting job remains safe because the Jags simply have too much invested in the former No. 1 overall pick, but Lawrence needs to be better. What he's shown through eight games of Year 2 simply isnât good enough."
2022,9,31,Detroit Lions,1-6,"Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Lions scored on their first five possessions Sunday and led for over 42 minutes of game time, but the final result was maddeningly consistent for Dan Campbell's team: a 31-27 loss to the Dolphins in which the defense could not get a stop when it counted. On Monday, Campbell announced he'd fired defensive backs coach Aubrey Pleasant, a lever a struggling team is known to pull when it's not sure what else to do. ""We're in a production-based business,"" said Campbell, ""and after seven weeks, I felt like this change needed to be made."" On Tuesday, the franchise traded its leading receiver, and former top-10 pick, T.J. Hockenson within the division. We're a long way off from the feel-good vibes of Hard Knocks ."
2022,9,32,Houston Texans,1-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 After a promising Week 7 showing that hinted at progress, the Texansâ offense cratered on Sunday against the Titans. Houston managed just 161 total yards in the 17-10 loss , with more than half of those yards coming on a final drive that produced a touchdown with 17 seconds to play. Davis Mills threw for just 17 yards in the first half, playing to a duel with Malik Willis , an overmatched rookie filling in for injured/ill Tennessee starter Ryan Tannehill . A quick rebound shouldnât be expected: Up next is the undefeated Eagles on Thursday Night Football . Oof."
2022,10,1,Philadelphia Eagles,8-0,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Philadelphia Eagles were founded in 1933. They are 8-0 for the first time ever. Turns out there can still be happiness after the demise of the Phillies . The Iggles continued their perfect start with an imperfect but ultimately satisfactory throttling of the Texans on Thursday Night Football . Keep an eye on the defense without Jordan Davis : The absence of the standout defensive tackle -- parked on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain -- was apparent against Houston, as Texans RB Dameon Pierce regularly bullied his way to the second level in a 139-yard night . Suspect run defense might be the only perceptible flaw for the ""new"" best team in football."
2022,10,2,Buffalo Bills,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 Consider Sunday's stunning 20-17 loss to the Jets a wakeup call to the Bills. Long an AFC East doormat, Gang Green has quickly built up a smothering and dynamic young defense that matches up well with Buffalo's powerful attack. New York's spectacular cornerback duo of Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed largely neutralized Stefon Diggs , while a surging Jets defensive front regularly harassed Josh Allen without the need to blitz. Allen tossed two interceptions and fumbled twice, his second consecutive sloppy performance. The question coming out of the Meadowlands: Were the Jets fortunate to catch the Bills on a bad week -- or has this division suddenly been turned upside down?"
2022,10,3,Kansas City Chiefs,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 How maddening must it be to try to stop Patrick Mahomes ? The superstar quarterback struggled to find consistency in the passing game on Sunday night against the Titans, so he used his legs on the fourth-quarter drive that forced overtime in the eventual 20-17 win . Scrambling has always been an underrated element of Mahomes' game, and it killed Tennessee in what was an otherwise sterling effort by Mike Vrabel's defense. One offensive subplot to track in Kansas City: Clyde Edwards-Helaire was on the field for just 17 percent of the snaps in the Chiefs' first game out of the bye. This might be Jerick McKinnon 's backfield to lead going forward."
2022,10,4,Dallas Cowboys,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ As Odell Beckham Jr. 's ACL rehab reaches its final stages, the drumbeat connecting the veteran to the Cowboys will only get louder. NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported last week that Beckham is ""firmly"" on Dallas' radar. It's a marriage that makes too much sense: Beckham is box office (which matters to Jerry Jones), and the Cowboys have a legitimate need at wide receiver beyond CeeDee Lamb . Michael Gallup still doesn't look like himself after his own ACL reconstruction. Rolling the dice on Beckham feels inevitable for America's Team."
2022,10,5,Baltimore Ravens,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 The passing game isn't pretty right now, but the Ravens can still win because they're great at pretty much everything else. Baltimore tallied 188 yards on the ground and smothered the Saints with a dominant defensive performance in a 27-13 win at the Superdome on Monday Night Football . The star of the evening was Justin Houston , who contributed 2.5 sacks and the game-sealing interception in the latest turn-back-the-clock performance for the 33-year-old. Houston is the first Ravens player in team history to register multiple sacks in three consecutive games -- not a bad return on investment for a veteran quietly brought back on a one-year deal in July."
2022,10,6,San Francisco 49ers,4-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 Perhaps feeling emboldened after Christian McCaffrey 's dominant hat-trick performance against the Rams, the Niners pulled the trigger on a trade that sent erstwhile starting running back Jeff Wilson Jr. to the Dolphins in exchange for a Day 3 draft pick. Parting ways with a quality depth piece behind the injury-prone McCaffrey would feel more risky if Elijah Mitchell weren't back on the radar. Mitchell, who is set to return Sunday night against the Chargers after missing two months with a knee injury, could be a starter for many teams. Pairing CMC with Mitchell gives San Francisco one of the most talented backfields in football."
2022,10,7,Minnesota Vikings,7-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Vikings once again found a way on Sunday against the Commanders , improving to 7-1 for the first time since 2009 and perhaps extinguishing any lingering drama about who will be crowned NFC North champions come January. T.J. Hockenson 's debut was incredibly encouraging: The ex-Lions tight end, who practiced just three times in Minnesota after last week's trade , hauled in all nine of his targets from Kirk Cousins for 70 yards. Justin Jefferson and Dalvin Cook will continue to be the main drivers of this offense, but Hockenson needed just one afternoon to prove how useful a playmaker at tight end can be in this attack."
2022,10,8,Tennessee Titans,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 It was right there . The Titans, with Ryan Tannehill tethered to the sideline by a bum ankle , were in position to score a massive upset win in prime time at Arrowhead. Unfortunately, the offense went to sleep after halftime, and Patrick Mahomes made big plays with his arm -- and, especially, his legs -- in a painful overtime loss . Malik Willis again looked like a developmental QB in over his head, completing just five of his 16 pass attempts for 80 yards. The combination of a healthy Derrick Henry and a stout defense should take the Titans back to the playoffs, but Tannehill must get right to keep Tennessee in the contender conversation."
2022,10,9,New York Jets,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 14 A week after a disappointing loss to the Patriots , the Baby Jets put together their most complete effort of the season in an upset of the mighty Bills . The defense was again outstanding, forcing Josh Allen into two interceptions while regularly putting the heat on the star quarterback. Allen was sacked five times and fumbled twice, routinely harassed by a defense that rarely blitzed but kept getting home. Fittingly, Allen's desperation final heave in the final minute was swatted away by cornerback Sauce Gardner , playing like an All-Pro just nine games into his career. Throw in a composed, bounce-back performance by Zach Wilson , and this was close to a perfect day for Gang Green."
2022,10,10,Seattle Seahawks,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 Thatâs three consecutive stellar efforts by Pete Carrollâs defense, which put the clamps on Kyler Murray and Co. in a 31-21 win over the Cardinals. Seattle sacked Murray four times, including two by Uchenna Nwosu (up to a career-high seven on the year), and allowed just 262 total yards -- the kind of yardage Seattle was yielding by halftime of games earlier this season. Kenneth Walker III went over 100 yards for the second straight week, while Geno Smith recovered from a third-quarter pick-six to put forward another solid performance. Up next: Seattle will take a healthy divisional lead overseas for a spotlight game against the Buccaneers in Munich."
2022,10,11,Cincinnati Bengals,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ It appears Joe Mixon has returned from the wilderness. The running back, who hadn't looked like himself for much of the season, went supernova against the Panthers -- piling up 211 total yards and five touchdowns in a 42-21 rout . The Bengals would love to see Mixon start stacking performances like this against better competition, but the back's Week 9 explosion is a huge relief for an offense that was looking vulnerable after the double-jab of Ja'Marr Chase 's hip injury and a humbling Halloween night loss to the Browns. Joe Burrow is the type of star quarterback who can carry teams in trying times, but Mixon needs to be himself to make Cincy a credible Super Bowl contender. Sunday was, well ... promising on that front."
2022,10,12,Miami Dolphins,6-3,"Previous rank: No.  12 When the Dolphins surrendered a first-round pick to land pass rusher Bradley Chubb , it was something of an admission their defense wasn't where they needed it to be through eight weeks. Chubb should make a difference in the long term, but Sunday's 35-32 shootout win over the Bears offered more evidence that Miami has a lot of work to do to improve on Josh Boyer's side of the ball. The Dolphins keep winning because Tua Tagovailoa and the offense are on a rampage: Tua went over 300 yards with three touchdowns for the second straight week, while Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle delivered their typical carnage (12 catches for 228 yards and two TDs combined). Had Tua not missed time, this offense would likely be on a historic pace."
2022,10,13,New York Giants,6-2,"Previous rank: No. 11 Stupid bye-week injuries are the worst. On Monday, we learned that safety Xavier McKinney , one of the breakout contributors on Big Blueâs surprisingly stout defense, will be out several weeks after breaking his hand in an ATV accident in Cabo. McKinney is New Yorkâs defensive play-caller and team captain, making the unfortunate circumstances connected to his journey to Mexico all the more troubling for head coach Brian Daboll. New York at least has the benefit of the kind of soft landing McKinney could have used: The Giants get the one-win Texans on Sunday at MetLife Stadium."
2022,10,14,New England Patriots,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 13 If itâs November, that must mean the Patriots are finding their way. This time of year has always been fertile ground for New England, a team that -- going back to the early days of Tom Brady -- has used the seasonâs initial months to tinker with the model. The model looked pretty damn good on Sunday, as the Pats piled up nine sacks and didnât allow a single third-down conversion in a dominant 26-3 win over the adrift Colts. Mac Jones remains a source of ongoing concern after another lukewarm performance, but the Pats are over .500 and in good position for yet another playoff push."
2022,10,15,Los Angeles Chargers,5-3,"Previous rank: No. 16 Justin Herbert is making it work. The quarterback made big throws when it counted on Sunday, leading the Chargers to a 20-17 win over the Falcons without his top two wide receivers . It's unclear how much more time Mike Williams and Keenan Allen will miss, but Herbert showed in Atlanta that he can make playmakers out of complementary roster pieces like Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter . Absurd fun fact: Austin Ekeler had zero touchdowns in the Bolts' first three games, but has 10 -- ten! -- in the last five. Ekeler is an underrated gem who will continue to eat as long as the L.A. wide receiver room remains a M.A.S.H. unit."
2022,10,16,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 20 Hot damn, did the Bucs need that one! Given one more opportunity after a three-and-out stop by the defense, Tom Brady quickly led the offense downfield before tossing the go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Cade Otton in the final minute of a 16-13 win over the Rams. ""That was awesome,"" a clearly relieved Brady said after the slump-busting victory . ""That was f------ awesome!"" The Bucs survived despite another shaky offensive performance that featured six drops, including a dreadful Scotty Miller end-zone flub that nearly cost Tampa Bay the game in the penultimate possession. Still, a win is a win -- and the Bucs now travel to Munich for a matchup against the Seahawks with potentially huge playoff implications ."
2022,10,17,Atlanta Falcons,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 18 With the Falcons and Chargers tied at 17 and just under five minutes to play, Marcus Mariota bought some time in the pocket and spotted Kyle Pitts , who had broken free, with a safety and corner in hopeless pursuit. If Mariota hits his dynamic young tight end in stride, it's very likely a 73-yard touchdown and possibly a game-winner. Instead, Mariota overshot Pitts by 5 yards , one of a host of inaccurate throws from the QB in a 20-17 loss . Mariota has had his moments this season, but Atlanta's run-heavy scheme is -- in some ways, one could surmise -- cover-up for a quarterback who can't shoot straight. It's hard to imagine Arthur Smith wanting to run this arrangement back in '23."
2022,10,18,Los Angeles Rams,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 15 Jalen Ramsey couldnât hold his tongue any longer. The defense had made a goal-line stand late in the fourth quarter only to be called on again after the ensuing Rams possession lasted three plays before a punt. âThe defense should not have had to go back on the field. Simple,â a visibly frustrated Ramsey said after a late Bucs TD sealed a brutal 16-13 l oss for the defending champs. âGotta have some dogs who are gonna go get it. We shouldnât come to the sideline after a big stop like that and our coaches or the other side or whoever telling us, âWe are going to need yâall one more time.â â¦ Like, what the f---?â Ramsey took his frustrations public, which can be perceived as a no-no, but can you blame him? The Rams' offense is simply not getting it done ."
2022,10,19,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 21 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ General manager Andrew Berry confirmed during the bye week what the football world presumed: Deshaun Watson will be the Brownsâ starting quarterback when he is eligible to return from suspension on Dec. 4 against the Texans . Watsonâs debut after nearly two seasons off the field profiles as the mother of all distractions for head coach Kevin Stefanski, who knows full well how divisive Watsonâs presence is after his off-the-field actions prompted a lengthy absence. In the here and now, the goal is to stack some wins and put Cleveland in the playoff picture by the time the controversial but talented QB takes the reins."
2022,10,20,New Orleans Saints,3-6,Previous rank: No. 17 You may now safely add the team from New Orleans to the list of expected NFC powerhouses who have badly disappointed in 2022. The Saints welcomed the Ravens into their building on Monday night and were thoroughly outplayed in a 27-13 loss that wiped away any goodwill gained from the previous week's win over the Raiders . Andy Dalton 's hold on the starting job could be loosening after his latest island-game flop: The veteran QB has lost 20 of 26 starts in prime time dating back to his years with the Bengals. Dalton didn't get much help from an offensive line that crumbled after center Erik McCoy exited with a calf injury. Bad night all around.
2022,10,21,Chicago Bears,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 24 In a season that's been defined in part by poor quarterback play in places you'd least suspect it, it's refreshing to watch a young player like Justin Fields make the leap in such profound fashion. The second-year man out of Ohio State was historically dangerous on Sunday, setting a Super Bowl-era record for QBs with 178 rushing yards in a 35-32 loss to the Dolphins. Fields accounted for four touchdowns, and he might have been the talk of the league this week had game officials not missed an obvious pass interference call on a deep attempt to Chase Claypool with 1:35 to play. Chicago's defense remains lost at sea without Robert Quinn and Roquan Smith , but Fields promises to keep this team compelling with a huge arrow up for 2023 and beyond."
2022,10,22,Green Bay Packers,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Lions were supposed to be the âget-rightâ opponent. Green Bayâs offense had been in a season-long funk, sure, but Detroitâs historically bad defense would be just what the Packers needed to find themselves. Instead, Aaron Rodgers struggled through his worst game of the season -- one of the worst games of his career -- in an ugly 15-9 loss at Ford Field. Two of Rodgersâ three interceptions came in the end zone in a day of misfires for the back-to-back reigning MVP. Offered Rodgers after the game : ""I played s---ty, but I never gave up.â OK. With the Cowboys and Titans on deck -- teams with two of the best defenses in football -- time may already be up for the once-mighty Packers. Stunning, really."
2022,10,23,Arizona Cardinals,3-6,"Previous rank: No.  22 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ New Sunday, same result for the Cardinals. Arizona looked flat and uninspired in an important divisional game, piling up 11 penalties and three fumbles in a 31-21 loss at home. Kyler Murray managed just 5.0 yards per attempt while the Arizona defense was unable to hold a second-half lead after Zaven Collins â acrobatic pick-six put the home team ahead midway through the third quarter. On the positive side, Arizona now leads the NFL with five defensive touchdowns! The Cards also scored a touchdown in the first quarter for the first time this season. On November 6th. Letâs just move on."
2022,10,24,Las Vegas Raiders,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 23 Simply inexcusable. Riding a dominant first half from Davante Adams , the Raiders jumped out to a 17-0 lead on Sunday before the wheels fell off in stunning fashion. After the game -- a 27-20 loss to the lowly Jaguars -- Derek Carr stood in front of the media and carefully chose his words. ""There is a lot I want to say, you know, but if I'm honest, I don't need to say it here,"" the quarterback said . ""There are things that will be said [internally] ... things in house that we'll talk about man to man and all that kind of stuff that could be addressed."" A season of huge promise is disintegrating to dust by early November, prompting questions of how strong the footing is beneath first-year coach Josh McDaniels."
2022,10,25,Washington Commanders,4-5,"Previous rank: No. 25 Thereâs an odd thing going on in Washington with Taylor Heinicke . The backup quarterback has proven over the past two seasons that heâs a middle-of-the-road type of player ... and yet the crowd at Commanders games absolutely loves him. Sundayâs loss to the Vikings featured multiple âHein-i-cke!â chants, which mostly died out after the fiery QB sailed a pass over the middle for the Harrison Smith interception that set up Minnesotaâs game-tying touchdown in the fourth quarter. Heinickeâs passion has endeared him to the fan base, but don't be surprised if Ron Rivera turns the keys of the offense back over to Carson Wentz when the time comes."
2022,10,26,Denver Broncos,3-5,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Broncos were sellers at the trade deadline , sending Bradley Chubb to the Dolphins in a blockbuster deal that gets Denver back into the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft. It's a move made with an eye on the future -- something that certainly wasnât in Denver's initial plan when it delivered a massive haul to Seattle to land Russell Wilson in the offseason. Even with Chubb gone -- the former first-rounder was enjoying his best season after an up-and-down start to his career -- the Broncos' defense should continue to get stops to keep the team in games. The question becomes whether Wilson and the offense can build off their game-winning drive over the Jags in Week 8 in London. If not, there will be much meaningless football to be played come December."
2022,10,27,Jacksonville Jaguars,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Jaguars have stumbled into their share of valleys this season, but you see progress being made with Doug Pederson at the helm. Take Sunday as an example: Jacksonville fell behind 17-0 in the second quarter before flipping the script on the Raiders in a 27-20 win . Trevor Lawrence delivered one of his best efforts of the season, displaying plus accuracy and decision making. The defense was even better after the slow start, shutting down Josh Jacobs and holding Davante Adams without a yard in the second half after a dominant first two quarters by the All-Pro wide receiver. Big tests lie ahead with the Chiefs and Ravens next on the schedule."
2022,10,28,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Chase Claypool era in Pittsburgh started with a bang and ended with a whimper. Last Tuesday, the Steelers traded the wide receiver to the Bears in exchange for a second-round pick. It was a good return for GM Omar Khan, but Claypoolâs exit underlined the disappointing nature of his final years in Pittsburgh after a breakout rookie season in 2020 that included 11 total touchdowns. Claypoolâs production cooled considerably in the seasons since, but mediocre-to-bad quarterback play in Pittsburgh canât be ignored when dissecting his numbers. With Claypool gone, rookie George Pickens and fourth-year pro Miles Boykin should be in line for more opportunities."
2022,10,29,Detroit Lions,2-6,"Previous rank: No. 31 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ After the Lions tasted victory again for the first time in seven weeks, Dan Campbell just wanted to go home and have a beer . Amen, brother. But before he could enjoy some well-earned lager, the coach needed to deliver an emotional locker room speech following his teamâs 15-9 win over the Packers and longtime tormentor Aaron Rodgers . âI told you Wednesday, men, I could smell something!â Campbell said . âYou could smell something in the air, and you guys rallied. ... Thatâs not easy. Thatâs a good win.â With that, Campbell flipped the game ball to Aaron Glenn, his embattled defensive coordinator. Letâs see if itâs the start of a rebound in the Motor City."
2022,10,30,Indianapolis Colts,3-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 28 After another grisly loss -- the team's third straight defeat -- Jim Irsay decided heâd seen enough. The Colts owner fired head coach Frank Reich on Monday, replacing him with team consultant and former All-Pro center Jeff Saturday. Itâs the kind of profoundly outside-the-box move you donât see in the league anymore, but Irsay has repeatedly proved himself to be a maverick in the ranks of owners. Whether Saturday is qualified for the job is the subject of understandable debate , but itâs clear Irsay is an owner desperate for answers and in search of people he can trust. Saturday fit that bill ... and so he gets the big chair (on an interim basis, anyway). Wild times in Indy."
2022,10,31,Houston Texans,1-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 Give the Texans some credit: They kept their Thursday Night Football matchup against the mighty Eagles more competitive than most expected. Davis Mills threw a pair of first-half touchdown passes and Dameon Pierce continued his Offensive Rookie of the Year charge with 139 yards on the ground . Pierce is clearly the most interesting talent on the offense; it could be helpful to make the dynamic young playmaker a more prominent part of the passing game. Pierce wasnât targeted once by Mills despite the 22-year-old rusher regularly putting Eagles defenders on their backs. Also untargeted? Wide receiver Brandin Cooks , declared inactive after a salty tweet minutes after last Tuesdayâs trade deadline."
2022,10,32,Carolina Panthers,2-7,"Previous rank: No. 29 Reality hit hard for the Panthers on Sunday . The Bengals rolled up 35 unanswered points before halftime in what was an absolute decimation on both sides of the ball. P.J. Walker struggled through a miserable first half before getting the mercy hook in favor of Baker Mayfield . The former starter led Carolina on three scoring drives in the final two quarters, but Steve Wilks announced that Walker will get the nod Thursday on a short week against the Falcons. With Sam Darnold back from injured reserve, this could be Walkerâs final start regardless of outcome."
2022,11,1,Philadelphia Eagles,8-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Eagles were overdue for a bad game, which is a fair classification of Monday night's 32-21 stumble to the Commanders at the Linc. Philly's first loss of the season included four turnovers and a crushing late-hit penalty against Brandon Graham , however unsatisfying the call might have been. The Eagles lost because they couldn't keep the Commanders' offense off the field: Washington ran 34 more plays than Philly and possessed the ball for more than 40 minutes of game time. The defense held its own despite all those extra snaps, but the offense wasn't sharp enough when its opportunities arrived. A frustrating loss, for sure, but the Eagles remain the top team in the NFC with an inside track to the No. 1 seed."
2022,11,2,Kansas City Chiefs,7-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 It wasn't the prettiest performance, but the Chiefs had plenty of margin for error against the Jaguars at Arrowhead. Patrick Mahomes threw four touchdown passes, and the running game came to life with 155 yards, including a game-high 82 from Isiah Pacheco . Clyde Edwards-Helaire continued his disappearing act from the offense, playing just four snaps without a touch, while new acquisition Kadarius Toney scored his first NFL touchdown in a promising performance. Kansas City can put a vise grip on another AFC West title with a win over the second-place Chargers on Sunday Night Football in Los Angeles."
2022,11,3,Minnesota Vikings,8-1,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ No matter how this season turns out, the Vikings and their fans will always cherish what happened on Sunday in Buffalo. Down 17 points late in the third quarter, Minnesota mounted a furious comeback behind standout performances from their most important players: money throws from Kirk Cousins , mind-exploding catches from Justin Jefferson , a game-changing run from Dalvin Cook , and glorious ball-hawking from Patrick Peterson in a 33-30 overtime win over the powerhouse Bills. It was the type of signature win against a Super Bowl favorite that gives the Vikings legitimacy beyond their stellar win-loss record. Said Peterson to the doubters: ""Look at us now. Look at us now. That's all I could say."""
2022,11,4,Miami Dolphins,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 12 You have to go back to the salad days of Dan Marino to find a Dolphins offense that felt this dangerous. Tua Tagovailoa threw for 285 yards and three more touchdowns, and Jeff Wilson Jr. had 119 of the team's 195 rushing yards as Miami steamrolled a Cleveland defense that shut down Joe Burrow and the Bengals in Week 9 . The Dolphins reach their bye in first place in the AFC East having averaged 35 points and nearly 450 yards per game in their last three weeks. Meanwhile, the ""M-V-P!"" chants for Tua at Hard Rock Stadium don't seem so far-fetched: eight starts, seven wins, 18 touchdown passes, three interceptions, 71 percent completion rate at a staggering 9.1 yards per attempt. Peak Steve Young stuff."
2022,11,5,Buffalo Bills,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 Another stomach-punch loss , this one made worse because of how avoidable it felt. The Bills blew a three-score lead in the second half by making the type of head-scratching, self-inflicted errors that have suddenly become commonplace. Josh Allen is the rightful focus of scrutiny after three more turnovers, which included the shocking goal-line fumble that produced Minnesota's go-ahead touchdown in the final minute in regulation, followed by the end-zone interception in overtime that sent the fans in Orchard Park home in a daze. ""Losing sucks. It sucks this way even more. Horrendous second half,"" Allen said. ""It comes down to my shoulders and my shoulders only. Making the right decisions, making the right throws. This one's going to suck, watching it."""
2022,11,6,Baltimore Ravens,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Ravens have hit their stride by locking into a familiar identity: running the ball down your throat. Lamar Jackson -- as always -- remains the centerpiece of everything Baltimore does on offense, with a league-leading average of 7.4 yards per attempt on a team-leading 86 carries. Gus Edwards , Kenyan Drake and Justice Hill have all stepped up when called upon. Much of the ground-game success can be traced back to a thriving offensive line that keeps getting better. Rookie center Tyler Linderbaum was yet another draft hit by the organization, while Ronnie Stanley 's return to health has brought stability to the blind side. This will not be a fun team to play as the weather turns cold."
2022,11,7,San Francisco 49ers,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 On paper, the 49ers should have a dominant offense if Jimmy Garoppolo can effectively distribute the ball to his cabal of talented teammates. We didnât quite get that in Sunday nightâs narrow win over the injury-ravaged Chargers. George Kittle was targeted just twice (one catch) and Deebo Samuel had just two receptions on six looks. Christian McCaffrey had four catches on six targets in the passing game, but was out-touched in the running game by Elijah Mitchell , who had 18 carries for 89 yards in his first action since Week 1. Brandon Aiyuk got his (six for 84 on seven targets), but overall this had the feel of Kyle Shanahan trying to figure out how to best roll out this attack when everyone is on the field at the same time. Rich-people problems, of course."
2022,11,8,Dallas Cowboys,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 The Cowboys had a two-touchdown lead in the fourth quarter and the opportunity to step on the throat of the Packers in their own building. Instead, the Dallas offense went cold, the defense couldn't get the big stop, and Green Bay walked off the visitors in a 31-28 overtime stunner . After the game, Mike McCarthy -- his Lambeau homecoming effectively ruined -- stood by his decision to bypass a long field-goal attempt and go for it on fourth-and-3 in overtime. With a defender wrapped around his legs on the play, Dak Prescott couldn't hit his target, leading McCarthy to chuck his headset into the turf -- a fitting display of frustration in this missed opportunity for Big D. ""I mean, I think it's disgusting,"" linebacker Micah Parsons said of the loss . ""It's something that just can't happen. Like, it's bad. We've got to be able to finish games in this league, especially when it's guys like (Aaron) Rodgers ."""
2022,11,9,Tennessee Titans,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 At long last, a Titans wide receiver has stepped up. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine provided a massive lift to Todd Downingâs scuffling passing attack, hauling in five receptions for 119 yards and two touchdowns in a 17-10 win over the Broncos. Both scoring tosses came from Ryan Tannehill , who was far from 100 percent after missing a week with a high ankle sprain, but still able to lead the offense on a pair of touchdown drives with Derrick Henry throttled by a stubborn Denver defense. The schedule does Tannehill and his bum ankle no favors: The Titans are back on the field again on Thursday for a road matchup against the Packers ."
2022,11,10,New York Jets,6-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 The rise of the Jets can be traced back to a defense that has grown up fast. The heart of the unit is Quinnen Williams , who has anchored the team's relentless front four with All-Pro level play. Williams reached New York's bye tied with Tennessee's Jeffery Simmons for the most pressures (35) among defensive tackles while pacing all DTs with seven sacks. He's added nine QB hits, per Pro Football Focus, and grades out as third at his position, according to PFF. Williams was a steady contributor who flashed star potential in his first three seasons. In 2022, he made the leap to bona fide Defensive Player of the Year candidate."
2022,11,11,Cincinnati Bengals,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Bengals had a bye week to further savor the long-awaited breakout performance from Joe Mixon , who set a franchise record with five touchdowns (to go along with 211 yards from scrimmage) in a blowout win over the Panthers in Week 9. Mixon entered the big day as one of the leagueâs least efficient runners: According to Next Gen Stats, Mixon rushed for 54 yards below expectation through the first eight weeks of the season â the third-worst figure of any running back with at least 50 carries. Against Carolina, Mixon rushed for 74 yards above expectation. With JaâMarr Chase sidelined indefinitely by a hip injury, the Bengals need the dynamic version of Mixon to stick around."
2022,11,12,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 16 Tom Brady called Sundayâs 21-16 win over the Seahawks -- the first NFL game ever played in Germany -- one of the best experiences of his 23-year career . The atmosphere was indeed excellent in Munich, but weâre guessing the continued improvement of the Bucs offense played a role in the G.O.A.T.âs overall enjoyment of his journey to Deutschland. Tampa Bay converted 10 of 15 third downs against the Seahawks and scored touchdowns on both of their trips to the red zone. These can be considered baby steps for an offense that remains more pedestrian than expected, but you get the feeling that Brady and the Bucs are starting to find their way as they hit their bye week. It will be shocking if any other team emerges from the NFC South come playoff time."
2022,11,13,New York Giants,7-2,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Giants continue to drive through their best player -- the NFLâs leading rusher and Comeback Player of the Year favorite -- Saquon Barkley . The veteran was the definition of a ""bell-cow back"" on Sunday against the Texans and their league-worst rush defense, piling up 152 yards and a touchdown on a career-high 35 carries in a 24-16 win . Itâs fair to question whether Giants coach Brian Daboll should consider curbing Barkleyâs usage -- heâs up to 198 carries in nine games after 181 rushes in 2021 and 2020 combined -- but you also understand it. The G-Men operate on a thin margin for error, and Barkley is their queen on the chess board."
2022,11,14,Seattle Seahawks,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 10 The fourth-quarter charge led by Geno Smith was spirited, but the trip to Munich was ultimately an empty one for the previously soaring Seahawks. Smith and the offense struggled to find rhythm before two late scoring drives, and the defense came down to Earth with a thud after a month of excellent play. Tampa Bay ran the ball well -- a rarity for the Bucs this season -- and Tom Brady was hit just once by the Seahawks pass rush. Add in Seattleâs struggles to get off the field (Tampa Bay converted 10 of 15 third downs) and you had the recipe for defeat. The Seahawks take a narrow division lead into the bye before a Week 12 matchup against the moribund Raiders."
2022,11,15,New England Patriots,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Pats are about to enter the teeth of their schedule. New England comes out of the bye with a rematch against the 6-3 Jets , followed by measuring-stick games against the 8-1 Vikings and 6-3 Bills . Three challenging opponents, in showdowns that will take place across the span of just 12 days. Expect plenty of scrutiny on Mac Jones during this gauntlet: The second-year passer struggled against a stout Jets defense in Week 8 , and itâs not hard to imagine more cries for underdog backup Bailey Zappe if Jones is unable to get it going in Foxborough on Sunday. Jones has yet to throw for more than one touchdown in a game this year and has been unable to eclipse a 90 passer rating in six tries (89.7 is the league-average rate through Week 10)."
2022,11,16,Green Bay Packers,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 22 Aaron Rodgers went on The Pat McAfee Show last week to remind the football world -- and perhaps, himself -- he is indeed the reigning back-to-back NFL MVP. It was a warning not to write off the Packers, words backed up by actions in a 31-28 overtime win over the Cowboys at Lambeau Field. Rodgers threw three touchdown passes (all to previously scuffling rookie Christian Watson ) and got much-needed help from running back Aaron Jones (138 yards) and backup safety Rudy Ford , who made the most of his opportunity with two crucial Dak Prescott interceptions in the first half. Weâre not ready to say the Packers are ""back,"" but the defibrillator pads have effectively returned a pulse to the reigning NFC North champs."
2022,11,17,Washington Commanders,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 25 There won't be many moments this season as unintentionally funny as Taylor Heinicke celebrating Brandon Graham 's late-hit penalty in the final minutes like he'd just successfully executed the helicopter dive in Super Bowl XXXII . Still, one controversial penalty shouldn't obscure an incredible prime-time performance by the Commanders, who knocked off the previously undefeated Eagles and put themselves right in the thick of the NFC playoff race. Washington's ball-control offense was remarkable, possessing the football for over 40 minutes of game time despite averaging just 4.1 yards per play. Huge turnovers made the difference, none bigger than Darrick Forrest 's fumble recovery after a 50-yard gain by receiver Quez Watkins midway through the fourth quarter. The Commanders had a marvelous time ruining everything ."
2022,11,18,Los Angeles Chargers,5-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 Justin Herbert had two chances to lead the Chargers on a game-winning drive in the final two minutes against the 49ers on Sunday night, but those possessions ended with a four-and-out and first-play interception . Underwhelming, to say the least, but Herbert is on an island right now. Mike Williams and Keenan Allen were both again sidelined by injuries, and Los Angeles also played without either of its starting tackles on the offensive line. Add in a defensive front ravaged by injuries, and itâs a familiar refrain for the Chargers: Imagine if this team were healthy? Problem is, the Bolts never are."
2022,11,19,Arizona Cardinals,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Colt McCoy proves his value at some point in every season. The veteran backup QB is as consistent as Christmas, and we saw it again in Sundayâs 27-17 win over the Rams in Los Angeles. McCoy wasnât spectacular, but he was steady -- running an efficient offensive attack that produced five scoring drives but fewer than 300 total yards. The Cardinals didnât commit a turnover and generally looked like a more functional operation despite the perfunctory penalty avalanche (10 more infractions worth 67 yards). McCoy is a nice fallback option, but Kyler Murray (hamstring) will need to be back on the field for the Cards to have a chance in a key divisional matchup against the 49ers on Monday night in Mexico City."
2022,11,20,Chicago Bears,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 21 The outcome of the game against the Lions was disappointing -- make a PAT, Cairo Santos ! -- but there continues to be reason for optimism around the Bears in what should be remembered as an important transition season for the franchise. Justin Fields was again electric , throwing for two scores and running for two others -- it was his second straight week with four total touchdowns. Fields now leads all QBs with 749 rushing yards and has 25 carries of at least 10 yards, the third-most of any player in the league. His fourth-quarter pick-six was a reminder that the second-year QB remains a work in progress as a passer, but we've seen significant gains in that department, as well. This is a 23-year-old who has put the league on notice."
2022,11,21,Detroit Lions,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 29 Are the Lions putting it together? Detroit did something unprecedented in the Dan Campbell era on Sunday -- it won a game outside of Ford Field. The 31-30 victory over the Bears -- the Lionsâ second straight after a five-game skid -- was especially encouraging because it was the struggling defense that really stepped up: Jeff Okudah pulled Detroit even with a dramatic pick-six in the fourth quarter , and a host of defenders swarmed a red-hot Justin Fields for the decisive sack on fourth down in the final minutes. ""You want to learn to win in close games, you win in close games,"" Campbell said. ""That's two now.â"
2022,11,22,Atlanta Falcons,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 17 How much more patience can Arthur Smith have in Marcus Mariota ? The veteran quarterback delivered another dud on Thursday Night Football , showing poor accuracy and suspect decision-making in a 25-15 loss to the Panthers. Mariota wasnât the only no-show for Atlanta, which was outplayed on offense, defense and special teams by a Carolina team that had trailed its opponent 42-0 in the third quarter just four days earlier. With first place in the NFC South still conceivably within reach, Smith is hesitant to turn the season over to third-round rookie Desmond Ridder . Still, Mariota canât have too much rope after his recent struggles."
2022,11,23,New Orleans Saints,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 20 The Saints are not a very good team right now. We were reminded of that again on Sunday in Pittsburgh, where New Orleans struggled to run the football, make dynamic plays in the passing game or avoid self-inflicted errors in a 20-10 loss to the Steelers. The drumbeat will begin to grow louder for the return of Jameis Winston , though it's hard to say how much of a difference the quarterback can make behind a beat-up offensive line. Said Dennis Allen: ""There's just a lot of different areas that we've got to improve on."" It's fair to wonder if Allen's job could be in danger if New Orleans doesn't get better down the stretch."
2022,11,24,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Browns were unable to carry any momentum from their Halloween beatdown of the Bengals to Miami. The Dolphins went up and down the field on the defense all afternoon, giving their punter the day off in a 39-17 blowout at Hard Rock Stadium. The goal has always been -- whether anyone connected to the Browns has said so or not (they haven't) -- to get to Deshaun Watson 's Week 13 return in playoff contention. With Cleveland at 3-6 with matchups against Josh Allen and Tom Brady on tap between now and then, it feels more probable that the Browns' postseason hopes will be kaput before Watson takes his first snap."
2022,11,25,Pittsburgh Steelers,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 28 The return of T.J. Watt means the Steelers wonât be getting pushed around anymore. The reigning Defensive Player of the Year didnât fill up the box score on Sunday against the Saints, but he drew plenty of attention and created opportunities for teammates in a 20-10 win . While Watt was getting up to speed, Najee Harris looked like a player who was finally getting on track. The second-year running back had 99 of Pittsburghâs 217 rushing yards, ground production that took the pressure off Kenny Pickett , who threw for 199 yards without a turnover. This isnât the most exciting football in the league, but the Steelers are just happy to get back to winning."
2022,11,26,Los Angeles Rams,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 18 How much worse can the Rams offense be without Matthew Stafford ? The answer: A lot worse. The defending champions continued their descent into also-ran status with a 27-17 loss to the Kyler Murray-less Cardinals at home. John Wolford couldnât get anything going in place of Stafford (concussion protocol), and the Los Angeles defense was unable to produce a game-swinging play to pick things up on the other side of the ball. The future doesnât look any brighter after Cooper Kupp exited the loss in the fourth quarter with a nasty-looking ankle injury . The NFL hasnât had a repeat Super Bowl champion in nearly 20 years -- this Rams team doesnât appear capable of putting that streak in any jeopardy."
2022,11,27,Indianapolis Colts,4-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Colts are the most unpredictable show on television. Just six days after the dismissal of Frank Reich and stunning hire of Jeff Saturday , Indy threw another curveball with the surprise decision to bring Matt Ryan out of mothballs and send the overmatched Sam Ehlinger back to the bench. Ryan took the opportunity and made the most of it , running the offense like the decorated veteran he is in a 25-20 win over the Raiders . It certainly helped Ryan that the offensive line played its best game of the year and Jonathan Taylor suddenly looked like his 2021 superstar self again. This had to be a tremendously annoying game for Reich to be watching from his couch."
2022,11,28,Jacksonville Jaguars,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 27 You have to tip your cap to Doug Pederson: Opening a game at Arrowhead with a successful onside kick is the good stuff. Unfortunately, that felt like the highlight of the game for the underdog Jags, who showed they weren't ready to hang with one of the elite teams in football. To Jacksonville's credit, they kept the game from getting ugly after falling behind Kansas City 20-0 in the second quarter. Trevor Lawrence elicited praise from Tony Romo on the CBS broadcast and continues to look more comfortable running the offense as the season progresses. His connection with Christian Kirk -- 105 yards, two touchdowns -- is one of the positive subplots of a developmental season."
2022,11,29,Las Vegas Raiders,2-7,"Previous rank: No. 24 ""Rome was not built in a day."" Those were the words of Raiders owner Mark Davis, per ESPN, when asked about the job security of first-year coach Josh McDaniels in the wake of an embarrassing loss to the chaos-drenched Colts at Allegiant Stadium. ""People in today's world want instant gratification,"" Davis added. ""The guy's coached nine games. We're 2-7, not the results we're looking for, but at the same time, we've lost six one-score games with the ball and a chance to win at the end."" Derek Carr 's emotional press conference on Sunday told the story of a season that's been brutally frustrating for everyone involved. Davis' public statement of patience is surely appreciated."
2022,11,30,Denver Broncos,3-6,"Previous rank: No. 26 The worst thing you can say about the state of the Broncos is how doomed the operation felt even with Denver in the red zone in the final minute on Sunday with a chance to tie the game. Weâve simply seen too much evidence of ineptitude to be surprised when Russell Wilson âs final pass sailed over the middle and was tipped into the hands of Titans cornerback Terrance Mitchell to clinch a 17-10 defeat . Wilson again struggled to recognize pressure and get the ball out, but the embattled QB was in a nearly impossible situation with third-stringers playing at center and right tackle. Throw in a first-quarter ankle injury to Jerry Jeudy that knocked him out of the game, and the recipe for another frustrating Sunday was in place."
2022,11,31,Carolina Panthers,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 32 P.J. Walker got off the mat after the embarrassment of Week 9âs blowout loss to the Bengals, but he wonât be able to build off the gains we saw in last Thursdayâs win over the Falcons. The Panthers announced Monday that Baker Mayfield will return to the starting lineup on Sunday after an MRI revealed Walker suffered a high ankle sprain against the Falcons. Sam Darnold , yet to play a snap this season after his own high ankle sprain led to a lengthy absence, will be the backup against the Ravens. Donât be surprised if both former first-round picks take snaps in Week 11 ."
2022,11,32,Houston Texans,1-7-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 While the passing game remains stuck in cement, Dameon Pierce continues to be the lone beacon of light in the Texans offense. The fourth-round pick -- a contender for Offensive Rookie of the Year honors -- did most of the heavy lifting in a 24-16 loss to the Giants, finishing with 122 scrimmage yards, including a game-high 44-yard run that set up Houstonâs only points of the first half. Pierce is on pace to rush for nearly 1,500 yards and has added 22 catches and a touchdown in the passing game. Itâs not a stretch to say Pierce is the offense. Get the guy some help."
2022,12,1,Kansas City Chiefs,8-2,"Previous rank: No. 2 When Patrick Mahomes took the field with 1:46 to play, two timeouts and his team trailing by four points to the Chargers on Sunday Night Football , NBC flashed up an absurd graphic stating the Chiefs had -- analytically speaking -- a 24 percent chance to win the game. It was silly in the moment and downright laughable after Mahomes rolled down the field in five plays, before connecting on a third touchdown pass to Travis Kelce in a 30-27 win at SoFi Stadium. Kelce, 33, is having one of his finest seasons and heâs been especially unstoppable in front of the biggest audiences: Eight of his league-leading 11 TDs have come in prime-time games."
2022,12,2,Philadelphia Eagles,9-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Eagles saw their dreams of an undefeated season go up in smoke against the Commanders in Week 10 . On Sunday, they were staring down a two-game losing streak -- but the offense came to life just in time. Jalen Hurts led Philly to two fourth-quarter touchdowns, the final score coming on a QB draw with 80 seconds to play to seal a 17-16 victory at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Eagles have won seven straight regular-season road games dating back to last year and now sit a game ahead of the Vikings in the race for the top seed in the NFC. ""Lots to clean up, for sure,"" center Jason Kelce said, acknowledging Philly's sleepy first three quarters. ""We played a bad game on offense."""
2022,12,3,Dallas Cowboys,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 That is what you call a certified Statement Game. The Cowboys went up to Minneapolis and lit up the Vikings in a 40-3 win that put the whole of the NFC on notice and buried the disappointment of the previous weekâs defeat to the Packers. Dak Prescott was sharp, the defense was dominant, Brett Maher drilled a 60-yard field goal ( two, really ), and Tony Pollard once again reminded us we are living in a post-Zeke world when talking about the most important player in the Dallas backfield. Up next is a Thanksgiving date with a Giants team that should be nervous about getting the Cowboys at this moment."
2022,12,4,Buffalo Bills,7-3,Previous rank: No. 5 The most trying stretch of the Billsâ season entered theater-of-the-absurd territory when a massive snowstorm buried Western New York and forced the team to move shop to Detroit for a âhomeâ game against the Browns. The Bills then played like a team that had literally shoveled its way out of Buffalo in the first half before finding itself in a 31-23 win at Ford Field. The emergence of the running game was notable: The Bills dialed up a season-high 33 runs for 171 yards -- James Cook and Devin Singletary each rushed for 86 yards in the win. Weâll see if Buffalo commits to this new balance on offense on Thanksgiving against the Lions .
2022,12,5,San Francisco 49ers,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 When this offense is healthy and humming -- as it was on Monday Night Football in Mexico City -- it can feel unfair. Christian McCaffrey . Deebo Samuel . George Kittle . Brandon Aiyuk . Elijah Mitchell . It's an embarrassment of riches for Jimmy Garoppolo , who got the ball into the hands of his playmakers with expert proficiency in a 38-10 wipeout of the overmatched Cardinals. Garoppolo threw four touchdown passes without a turnover and regularly connected with wide-open receivers running free against an Arizona defense that packed it in by the fourth quarter. Add in a physical and imposing defense, and this team is ready for liftoff."
2022,12,6,Tennessee Titans,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 9 Thursday nightâs 27-17 win at Green Bay was the best evidence yet that Tennessee should be viewed as a serious Super Bowl contender. This largely goes back to the long-overdue arrival of the passing game: Ryan Tannehill was excellent, carving up the Packers' secondary with precision and showing no ill-effects from the high ankle sprain that cost him time. Rookie Treylon Burks went over 100 yards for the first time thanks to the dagger 51-yard catch-and-run in the final minutes, Robert Woods moved the sticks with big catches, and Austin Hooper was nails in the red zone with two scores. Derrick Henry will remain the heart of the Titans' attack, but this is the type of balance that lifts the ceiling in Nashville."
2022,12,7,Miami Dolphins,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 Dolphins management is on a heater in their personnel game. Recent draft picks like Tua Tagovailoa and Jaylen Waddle are looking like masterstrokes, while Tyreek Hill has lived up to his gaudy price tag on a weekly basis. Now look at the rebuilt backfield: Jeff Wilson Jr. and Raheem Mostert -- both 49ers reserves a year ago -- have formed a formidable 1-2 punch that's helped make Miami's sizzling attack unstoppable. Wilson -- acquired at the trade deadline -- has been especially productive, accounting for 215 total yards and two touchdowns on 31 touches in his first two games in teal. Mike McDaniel has a growing bag of toys that would make Santa jealous."
2022,12,8,Baltimore Ravens,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Should we be worried about the Ravens' offense? It's fair to ask the question after John Harbaugh needed a huge effort from his defense to grind out a 13-3 win over the Panthers. Baltimore's only touchdown in the game came on a 1-yard run from Lamar Jackson set up by a Marcus Peters forced fumble deep in Carolina territory. Tight end Mark Andrews made his presence felt in his return to the lineup, but the Ravens simply need to get more from their passing game on days when their prolific rushing attack is held in check. They survived Sunday because the opponent was subpar. It won't always be that way."
2022,12,9,Minnesota Vikings,8-2,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ An afternoon that began with deafening âSkol!â chants and sky-high confidence ended with a half-empty stadium and a 40-3 defeat that makes you wonder how good these Vikings really are despite their stellar win-loss record. There was no one culprit in the stunning blowout to the Cowboys: Kirk Cousins was under constant duress, Justin Jefferson was largely neutralized, and the defense had no answers for Dallasâ passing or run game. ""This league has a way of humbling any football team at any point in time if you don't play good football,"" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said after the carnage. Yep, a Bury The Ball game if ever there was one."
2022,12,10,Cincinnati Bengals,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 Joe Burrow , in case you might have forgotten, is that dude. The Bengals quarterback didn't have Ja'Marr Chase (hip) for the third straight week and he was forced to find a way on Sunday without Joe Mixon , the star running back who exited the game with a concussion. Burrow was nails anyway, throwing for 355 yards and four touchdowns in a 37-30 win over a stubborn Steelers team. Patrick Mahomes feels like the favorite in the NFL MVP race, but don't be surprised if Burrow makes a charge along with the rest of the Bengals in the season's final weeks. Speaking of Chase, Bengals coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the star wideout is on target to return to practice this week."
2022,12,11,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 12 The win in Germany was a huge lift for the Bucs, who hit the bye at .500 and alone in first place in the soggy NFC South. Now weâll see if the offense can build off what went right in Munich. Specifically, the Bucsâ league-worst rushing attack finally got off the mat in a 161-yard effort. The ground game was led by rookie Rachaad White , who went over 100 yards rushing for the first time in his career. Leonard Fournette exited the win in Munich with a hip issue, and itâs unclear if the veteran will be limited in Week 12. Either way, White deserves a greater workload going forward."
2022,12,12,Seattle Seahawks,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Seahawks come out of their bye in great shape. Geno Smith has been a revelation at QB, rookie Kenneth Walker III is a home-run hitter at running back, the offensive line has been solid and the defense has found its way after a rocky start. Well, the D had found its way until it ran into Tom Brady in Munich. The Bucs converted on 10 of 13 third downs in non kneel-down situations during the 21-16 loss for the 'Hawks, the unwelcome return of a team weakness. Seattle surrendered conversions at nearly a 50 percent rate in the first five weeks before knocking that down to 34.4 percent during the four-game winning streak. Let's see if Pete Carroll's defense can get off the field on Sunday against the Raiders ."
2022,12,13,New England Patriots,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 The Patriots may not be the juggernaut they once were, but they remain King Kong when a young and vulnerable quarterback enters their airspace. New Englandâs defense completely erased Zach Wilson and the New York offense on a windy day in Foxborough, but continued issues for the Patsâ own attack necessitated the emergence of a hero . Enter rookie Marcus Jones , whose 84-yard punt return TD with under 30 seconds to play won the game and gave Patriots fans their most electrifying moment of the season. The Pats are in playoff position with a huge test looming against the 8-2 Vikings on Thanksgiving night ."
2022,12,14,New York Jets,6-4,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ What is about the Patriots that brings out the worst in young Jets quarterbacks? Zach Wilson was abysmal in Sunday's 10-3 loss at Foxborough, leading the offense to 2 total yards in the second half before Marcus Jones ' stunning punt return crushed Gang Green in the final seconds. On Monday, Robert Saleh opened the door to a quarterback change . ""We're keeping everything on the table the next couple of days,"" the coach said. If Wilson gets the call on Sunday against the Bears , he'll be under enormous pressure to produce. This is a coach challenging his young passer while acknowledging the concerns of a frustrated locker room."
2022,12,15,New York Giants,7-3,"Previous rank: No. 13 Was Sunday a bad day for the Giants ... or the beginning of a reality check? Big Blue welcomed the Lions to the Meadowlands and were outplayed on both sides of the ball in a 31-18 loss . Saquon Barkley was bottled up by Detroit's improving defense, while Daniel Jones threw his first interceptions since Week 3. Throw in some lackluster run defense -- Jamaal Williams and D'Andre Swift combined for four scores for Detroit -- and you had the recipe for a disappointing afternoon in chilly East Rutherford. The Giants don't have much time to lick their wounds: They'll head to Dallas on Thanksgiving for a matchup with the dangerous Cowboys."
2022,12,16,Washington Commanders,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Commanders are a thing in the NFC playoff race . Thatâs the only reasonable deduction after a 23-10 win over the moribund Texans moved Washington over the .500 mark for the first time since the season-opening win over Jacksonville . Thatâs five wins in six weeks for the Commanders, with four wins in five starts for Taylor Heinicke . After the game, Ron Rivera made it clear that this is Heinickeâs job as long as the team continues to win. âWe are going to go with Taylor, and we'll work Carson (Wentz) back in and see where Carson is in terms of when he's ready to be the backup,"" the coach said. ""Then, we'll go from there."" Wentz has been sidelined since mid-October by a finger injury."
2022,12,17,Los Angeles Chargers,5-5,"Previous rank: No. 18 Another heartbreaker for the Bolts. Brandon Staleyâs team went toe-to-toe with the mighty Chiefs for four quarters on Sunday Night Football , but they couldnât solve the eternal Patrick Mahomes -to- Travis Kelce conundrum in a 30-27 loss that effectively puts the AFC West division race to bed. Keenan Allen finally looked like his old self in his return to the lineup, but Mike Williams â own return was short-lived due to more ankle issues. Thereâs a really compelling AFC contender hidden away within the Chargers ... we know this. But time is running out to bring that side of the team to the forefront."
2022,12,18,Detroit Lions,4-6,"Previous rank: No. 21 The Detroit Lions are ready to move beyond the ""lovable loser"" phase of their development. Dan Campbell's Grit Warriors continued their ascent on Sunday, outplaying the Giants on both sides of the ball in a 31-18 win at MetLife Stadium. Detroit is suddenly in second place in the NFC North and within striking distance in the NFC wild-card race . The Lions rushed for 160 yards and four touchdowns against the Giants, three of the scores courtesy of, um, NFL touchdown leader Jamaal Williams . Bet you didn't have that in your preseason prediction column. Said Jared Goff of Williams: "" He's our horse. """
2022,12,19,Green Bay Packers,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 16 The win over the Cowboys was supposed to be the jumping-off point for a second-half renaissance. Instead, the Packers are right back where they started after a deeply disappointing 27-17 loss in the prime time to the Titans. Green Bayâs defense largely neutralized Derrick Henry , but didnât have an answer for a previously dormant Tennessee passing attack. Then there was the issue of Aaron Rodgers , who followed up a brilliant outing against Dallas with another head-scratching game of misfires in key moments. After the loss, Randall Cobb acknowledged the desperation of a supposed superpower that finds itself on the canvas before Thanksgiving: ""You lose another one, and you might as well say we're probably out [of the playoffs]."" Accurate."
2022,12,20,Atlanta Falcons,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Falcons kept themselves in the NFC playoff picture with a 27-24 win over the Bears, but the victory came at a cost. Tight end Kyle Pitts was placed on injured reserve Monday after an MRI revealed what is believed to be a torn MCL that's likely to require surgery. It's another frustrating layer to a difficult second season for the former No. 4 overall pick, who has rarely seemed to be on the same page with quarterback Marcus Mariota . ""He has such a huge impact on this team,"" Arthur Smith said. ""I know the numbers aren't as gaudy as they were as a rookie and he's been playing through a lot, and he's a tough guy and he has had a huge impact."" We'd say the Falcons would run the ball more with Pitts on the shelf, but that might not be possible for a team that has already logged 110 more carries than throws so far this season."
2022,12,21,New Orleans Saints,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 23 There will be no talk of a quarterback controversy in New Orleans this week. That might be as big a victory as the one the Saints got on the field Sunday, a 27-20 conquest over the Rams that all but extinguished any lingering playoff hopes for the defending champs. Andy Dalton threw three touchdown passes and posted a career-best passer rating of 149.6 in an outing that will quiet the Jameis Winston chatter for the time being. His top receiver was Chris Olave , who caught a long touchdown pass and went over 100 yards for the third time this season. The Offensive Rookie of the Year rÃ©sumÃ© is growing."
2022,12,22,Arizona Cardinals,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Cardinals looked disinterested against the 49ers on Monday in Mexico City. By the end of a 38-10 shellacking , after multiple Arizona players made ""business decisions"" on George Kittle 's catch-and-run touchdown in the fourth quarter, Troy Aikman had seen enough from the ESPN booth. ""This is embarrassing for the Arizona Cardinals,"" the Hall of Famer said. ""They're a losing football team and they're playing like one on that play."" It's just one play, of course, but it speaks to bigger concerns about the culture in Arizona under Kliff Kingsbury. Lack of effort. Lack of results. Maybe we'll see some accountability on Hard Knocks ."
2022,12,23,Chicago Bears,3-8,"Previous rank: No.  20 The rise of Justin Fields has been the single most important development of the 2022 season for the Bears. Now, the dynamic QB's uncertain health has put all that optimism on hold. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Fields sustained a left shoulder dislocation during Sunday's loss to the Falcons. Fields finished the game in considerable pain , and coach Matt Eberflus described Fields as ""day to day"" on Monday. With the Bears facing the Jets and their relentless pass rush in Week 12 , it could make sense to give Fields a week to recover. Of course, Chicago will purposely keep an air of mystery around the situation as game day approaches."
2022,12,24,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Cleveland Browns are a weird little outfit, arenât they? You never know which version of Kevin Stefanskiâs team will show up. On Sunday at Ford Field, we got both Jekyll and Hyde. Cleveland came out moving the ball up and down the field on the Bills, while Josh Allen struggled to find his footing against an active Browns defense. At one point in the second quarter, Cleveland had 10 first downs to Buffaloâs 12 total yards. The Bills eventually took control of the game, but it was a reminder the Browns have been very competitive for most of the season. The playoffs might be a pipe dream, but adding Deshaun Watson to the mix could make Cleveland a tough out down the stretch."
2022,12,25,Pittsburgh Steelers,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 25 The Steelers remain very much under construction. Pittsburgh had its two longest offensive touchdown plays of the season in Sunday's loss to the Bengals -- a 19-yard touchdown run by Najee Harris and a 24-yard touchdown catch by George Pickens -- but the Kenny Pickett -led attack also disappeared for extended stretches, most noticeably during a third quarter in which Pittsburgh failed to register a first down. The defense was similarly scattershot. The Steelers constantly pressured Joe Burrow and grabbed two interceptions, but they still surrendered touchdown drives of 79, 92 and 93 yards despite the absence of Ja'Marr Chase (hip) from the Bengals' lineup."
2022,12,26,Las Vegas Raiders,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 29 That had to feel incredible for Derek Carr and the Raiders. In a season defined by crushing losses in the final seconds, Carrâs 35-yard touchdown hookup with Davante Adams on the third play of overtime ensured Vegas would avoid being on the nail end of the hammer for once. Lots has gone wrong for Las Vegas in this lost season, but the Carr-to-Adams chemistry has been as good as advertised: Adams is up to 10 touchdowns on the season and has three games with at least 100 yards and two scores. If youâre having a conversation about the best wide receiver in football, Adams' name must be raised."
2022,12,27,Indianapolis Colts,4-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Colts very nearly moved to 2-0 under interim head coach Jeff Saturday, but a disappearing act by the offense doomed Indy in a 17-16 loss to the Eagles at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts totaled 75 yards on their game-opening touchdown drive ... then averaged just 20.9 yards per drive and scored nine points total for the rest of the game. When Jalen Hurts went untouched into the end zone in the final minute, it was another Indy opportunity lost in a season filled with them. ""That's a tough one to swallow,"" quarterback Matt Ryan said. ""Make no mistake, that's a good football team. We did a lot of really good things, but we made too many mistakes and that one feels like we let it get away."""
2022,12,28,Los Angeles Rams,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Rams have a Super Bowl hangover thatâs going to take a lot more than Advil and a greasy burger to cure. A 27-20 loss to the Saints at the Superdome all but erased whatever playoff chances remained for the defending champs. To make matters worse, Matthew Stafford -- who missed Week 10 and didnât clear concussion protocol until Friday -- was taken to the locker room in the second half for another concussion evaluation . Given the teamâs poor record and continued absence of Cooper Kupp , it will be very surprising if the Rams donât manage Staffordâs health with exceeding caution moving forward."
2022,12,29,Jacksonville Jaguars,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Jaguars caught criticism during free agency when they handed out a rich contract to wide receiver Christian Kirk , who had been productive but not especially explosive during his four years with the Cardinals. Cut to the end of November, and Kirk now has the look of a wise investment. The wideout caught his seventh touchdown pass of the season in Week 10âs loss to the Chiefs and is on pace for nearly 90 receptions and more than 1,100 yards in his first season in Duval. Most promising, Kirk has clearly won the trust of Trevor Lawrence , the quarterback who targets his No. 1 option in money time every week. Thatâs a free-agent hit if you ask us."
2022,12,30,Denver Broncos,3-7,"Previous rank: No. 30 Week 11 brought more of the same for the lost Broncos offense, which flashed signs of life early before another deep hibernation in a 22-16 overtime loss to the Raiders. Russell Wilson failed to throw a touchdown pass against one of the leagueâs worst passing defenses, while Melvin Gordon had yet another goal-line fumble to help doom a promising drive before halftime. On Monday, the Broncos cut ties with Gordon , who is the teamâs leader in carries (90), yards (318) and -- yes -- fumbles (5) this season. The changes are sure to continue for the disappointing Broncos in the weeks and months to come."
2022,12,31,Carolina Panthers,3-8,"Previous rank: No. 31 We donât know if Steve Wilks has a realistic chance at holding onto the big chair in Carolina after his interim run ends in January, but Sundayâs 13-3 loss to the Ravens showed he remains a coach capable of getting the best out of a defense. The Panthers entered the game as heavy underdogs, but were tied 3-3 before turnovers tilted the contest to Baltimore. The path to a 2022 debut for Sam Darnold could be clear after yet another uninspired start by Baker Mayfield . Please try to contain your excitement."
2022,12,32,Houston Texans,1-8-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 You can make a case for a few teams when debating the best team in the NFL right now. Itâs less of a debate when singling out which is the worst. The Texans remain stuck on one win after a 23-10 loss to the Commanders in which the offense managed just 148 total yards and were outgained 246-5 in the first half, the fewest net yards in a half in franchise history. ""There's not a whole lot that we're doing well,"" coach Lovie Smith said after Houstonâs fifth straight loss. ""We're building. We're not quite there yet. We're not a good football team right now."" He said it."
2022,13,1,Philadelphia Eagles,10-1,"Previous rank: No. 2 Monster performances in prime-time games can serve as ultra fuel in an MVP race. Jalen Hurts showed a huge audience what a difference-maker he can be on Sunday Night Football , breaking Michael Vick's franchise record for quarterbacks with 157 rushing yards in a 40-33 win over the Packers. Hurts also became the first NFL QB since at least 1950 with 150 rush yards, 150 passing yards and at least two passing scores in a single game. The Eagles nearly made team history, as well: Philly rushed for a whopping 363 yards, falling just 13 yards shy of the franchise record, set way back in 1948. Said RB Miles Sanders : ""It's chasing greatness every week."""
2022,13,2,Kansas City Chiefs,9-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Chiefs weren't quite themselves on Sunday, but their margin of error was significant against the fallen Rams and backup QB Bryce Perkins at Arrowhead. The 26-10 win was decisive despite special teams issues, red-zone flubs and a general air of ""meh"" that left Patrick Mahomes unimpressed after it was over. ""You like the win, but we have a lot to get better at,"" Mahomes said, ""especially me."" Mahomes threw an end-zone interception in the fourth quarter, but he also found Travis Kelce for yet another touchdown . Kelce has set a new career high with 12 receiving touchdowns, and there are six games yet to be played."
2022,13,3,San Francisco 49ers,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 5 The 49ers are an NFL superpower because they can thump you in different ways. Two Mondays ago in Mexico City , we saw what the offense can do when it's in a groove. On Sunday against the Saints, it was the defense's turn to flex its muscles in a 13-0 win . The Niners have not allowed a second-half point during their four-game winning streak, with opponents averaging a meager 10 points per game in that span. DeMeco Ryans' group will enter December as the No. 1 defense in the NFL in both yards and points allowed. The Niners have never finished a season atop both categories simultaneously in their rich history. There's something special cooking in Santa Clara."
2022,13,4,Dallas Cowboys,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ There's been an avalanche of speculation connecting Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cowboys, but perhaps America's Team would be better off without the famous wideout (and that's excluding factors connected to his recent air-travel misadventure ). Michael Gallup made several difficult contested catches in last Thursday's 28-20 win over the Giants, the surest sign yet he's rounding into form after offseason knee surgery. CeeDee Lamb continues to play the role of a bona fide No. 1 (logging two 100-yard efforts in the past three weeks), and a healthy Gallup profiles as a highly capable Robin to Lamb's Batman. Why mess with a good thing?"
2022,13,5,Buffalo Bills,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 Two games at Ford Field in five days and a pair of victories for the Bills, who look like a team finding its footing after some midseason turbulence. The 28-25 win on Thanksgiving was decided by Tyler Bass ' 45-yard field goal in the final seconds, but we'll remember the winning drive for the 36-yard missile from Josh Allen to Stefon Diggs that put Buffalo in scoring position in instantaneous fashion. Very few quarterbacks can hang a throw on a clothesline from that distance, and Allen managed it with a balky elbow that continues to give him issues. In other injury news, Von Miller exited the win with a knee issue that will put him on the shelf for an unknown duration. Buffalo's defense will not be the same without its closer."
2022,13,6,Miami Dolphins,8-3,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Dolphins took care of business against the league-worst Texans on Sunday -- jumping out to a 30-point halftime lead before coasting to a fifth consecutive victory -- and now here's where things get really interesting for Mike McDaniel and the AFC East leaders. Up next is a Week 13 road trip to face the red-hot 49ers, with more challenges to follow against the Chargers, Bills, Patriots and Jets, all teams in the AFC playoff race . Miami decimated the competition during the soft portion of its schedule; by the end of December, we'll have a much better handle on how seriously we should take this team in the conversation of Super Bowl contenders."
2022,13,7,Minnesota Vikings,9-2,"Previous rank: No. 9 The Thanksgiving night win over the Patriots was a crucial one for the Vikings, who were in dire need of a change to the conversation after the embarrassing blowout loss to the Cowboys four days earlier. Justin Jefferson was once again the driver of almost everything good in the Minnesota offense: The Pro Bowl wideout finished the game with nine catches for 139 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets. Jefferson's greatness makes life so much easier for Kirk Cousins , who quieted chatter about his failures in prime-time games until, well, the next time the Vikings play in prime time. Minnesota can clinch the NFC North with a win over the upstart Jets (and a Lions loss to the Jaguars) on Sunday."
2022,13,8,Cincinnati Bengals,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals went to Nashville and took out the Titans without the assistance of Joe Mixon (concussion) or Ja'Marr Chase (hip). It's the surest sign yet the defending AFC champions have found their way as the most difficult portion of the schedule arrives. ""This is the kind of game that great teams win,"" said Joe Burrow , who threw for 270 yards and the go-ahead score to Tee Higgins early in the fourth quarter. Burrow, sacked nine times by a fearsome Tennessee pass rush in Cincinnati's Divisional Round win in January, was sacked just once on Sunday. And now the best news for Burrow: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reports that Chase is on target to return for Week 13's showdown with the Chiefs."
2022,13,9,Tennessee Titans,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Titans win games by imposing their will on the opponent. On Sunday, the Bengals came to Nissan Stadium and were the more physical team on both sides of the ball in a 20-16 Tennessee loss that served as a rematch of January's memorable playoff showdown. An unnecessary roughness penalty by lineman Kevin Strong concluded the game in an anticlimactic manner , but the Titans' focus should be on how to get Derrick Henry going against an AFC rival they could see again come playoff time. Henry managed just 38 yards on 17 carries on Sunday and has averaged just 2.7 yards per rush in his last two meetings with Cincinnati. The Bengals have the Big Dog on a leash."
2022,13,10,New York Jets,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ For the second time in as many years, chants of "" Mike White !"" echoed from the rafters of the Meadowlands after a joyous Jets victory. The 27-year-old quarterback -- thrust into the starting lineup after last week's stunning benching of Zach Wilson -- completed 22 of 28 passes for 315 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions in a 31-10 win over the Bears at soggy MetLife Stadium. White completed passes to 10 different receivers and fed the ball to talented New York playmakers who have been starved for attention. Garrett Wilson put up 95 yards and scored twice one week after an emotional postgame outburst; even Elijah Moore busted out of witness protection with two big catches, including his first score of the year . The 2022 Jets are a roller coaster."
2022,13,11,Baltimore Ravens,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 8 The Ravens' inability to close out their opponents is increasingly looking like it could be a fatal flaw in the DNA of John Harbaugh's team. Baltimore is up to four losses on the season despite having a lead of at least nine points in the second half of all four of those games. The latest setback might have been the most brutal, as the defense was shredded by Trevor Lawrence on a last-minute touchdown drive before surrendering a two-point conversion to cap a 28-27 loss . Throw in a vulgar tweet from Lamar Jackson after the game (Harbaugh called it "" out of character ""), and the Ravens didn't exactly cover themselves in glory in Week 12."
2022,13,12,Los Angeles Chargers,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 17 Brandon Staley has endured his fair share of criticism during a frustrating Chargers season, but the coach deserves credit for putting faith in his offense in a dramatic 25-24 win over the Cardinals. With his team trailing by one point after a Justin Herbert touchdown pass to Austin Ekeler with 15 seconds to play, Staley sent his attack back on the field for the two-point conversion attempt. The Bolts rewarded their coachâs faith with a perfectly designed and executed completion to Gerald Everett to steal a win and keep pace in the ultra-competitive AFC Wild Card race . Said a smiling Staley of the game-winning play: "" Smooth like chocolate milk .â Um ... sure!"
2022,13,13,Washington Commanders,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 16 The qualifications for the Comeback Player of the Year are nebulous to start with, so letâs dispense with any overthinking and give the damn award to Brian Robinson Jr. The rookie running back was shot twice in the leg during an attempted robbery in August, made it back to the field in October, and, at the end of November, looks like the physical difference-maker the Commanders thought they were getting when they made him a third-round pick last April. On Sunday , Robinson registered his first 100-yard rushing performance and added a truck-stick receiving touchdown in a dramatic win over the Falcons. Pairing this version of Robinson with a bruising Washington defense constitutes a roadmap to more wins for the surging Commanders."
2022,13,14,Seattle Seahawks,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 12 It appears that the Seahawks have lost whatever they previously had found on defense. Seattle struggled to get off the field against Tom Brady and the Bucs in Munich before the Week 11 bye, and the 'Hawks came out of the off week with a disheartening 40-34 loss to a sub-.500 Raiders team that rolled up an absurd 576 total yards, capped by Josh Jacobs ' 86-yard touchdown run in overtime. (We're still trying to make sense of the angle taken by safety Josh Jones on Jacobs' game-winner.) The loss drops the Seahawks a game behind the 49ers in the NFC West and invites questions about whether Seattle has the balance to seriously contend down the stretch."
2022,13,15,New England Patriots,6-5,"Previous rank: No. 13 Hunter Henry caught it. We try not to dwell on these things, but wow, the decision to overturn the tight endâs apparent touchdown against the Vikings was an understandable source of major frustration for the Pats and their fan base in the aftermath of a 33-26 loss on Thanksgiving night. Thatâs not the reason New England finds itself back in last place in the uber-competitive AFC East, however. Self-inflicted errors were crucial: The Pats went 0 for 3 in the red zone, surrendered a kickoff return for a touchdown and committed five penalties that created first downs for the Vikings, including a critical running-into-the-kicker call that set up Minnesotaâs final touchdown. The Pats arenât good enough to cover up for sloppy execution."
2022,13,16,New York Giants,7-4,"Previous rank: No. 15 Are the Giants in a simple slump ... or is this an overachieving team coming back to Earth? Itâs a fair question after a 28-20 Thanksgiving loss to the Cowboys at Jerrah World, New Yorkâs second consecutive defeat. The 7-2 start to the season afforded Brian Dabollâs team wiggle room, but the pressure will be on with a pair of matchups with the surging Commanders in the next three weeks. Injuries have thinned a roster that wasnât deep to begin with, and Saquon Barkley has cooled off after an MVP-level beginning to the year. We're about to enter gut-check time for Big Blue."
2022,13,17,Las Vegas Raiders,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 26 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ We're starting to get the feeling the Raiders should have picked up the fifth-year option on Josh Jacobs ' rookie contract. Jacobs was a man possessed on Sunday in Seattle, setting a franchise record with 303 yards from scrimmage, including the 86-yard touchdown run in overtime that delivered a dramatic 40-34 win . That's two straight overtime conquests for the Raiders, who continue to play heart-attack football under Josh McDaniels. With a manageable schedule ahead (Vegas' next four opponents are a combined 19-25), it's not unreasonable to imagine the Silver & Black working their way back into the playoff picture . Of course, assuming anything when it comes to this team is asking to be made a fool."
2022,13,18,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,5-6,"Previous rank: No. 11 The calendar is about to flip to December, and the Buccaneers still can't get their offense on track. Tom Brady and Co. labored through another difficult Sunday, managing just 17 points in an overtime loss to the Browns. Tampa Bay had six three-and-outs, including a 14-second possession that preceded Cleveland's game-tying touchdown drive in the final minutes of regulation. Fixing what ails these Bucs will be a more difficult task without left tackle Tristan Wirfs , out multiple weeks after suffering a nasty-looking high ankle sprain during the overtime period. Said Brady of his blind-side protector: ""It's awful. It's awful for us, it's awful for him."""
2022,13,19,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Jacoby Brissett portion of the schedule is over, ending on a high note with an overtime win over the Bucs. Brissett, as he did throughout his 11-game tenure as starter, delivered a workmanlike effort that put Cleveland in a good position to win. ""I mean this in no disrespect,"" Brissett said of the comeback against his old teammate in New England. ""But in the words of Tom Brady , that was (expletive) awesome. That was (expletive) awesome."" Brissett now steps aside for Deshaun Watson , who will make his debut against the Texans in what signals a polarizing new era for the organization. When Watson takes his first snap against his former team, it will represent the QB's first true game action in 700 days."
2022,13,20,Detroit Lions,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 18 The Lions continue to show they can hang with just about any team in the league. The next step is finding ways to beat the best. The Bills escaped Ford Field with a 28-25 win thanks to a Tyler Bass field goal with two seconds to play , and it was the Lionsâ final drive minutes earlier that left fans playing the âWhat if?â game. Facing third-and-1 at the Buffalo 33-yard line with 32 ticks to play, Jared Goff spotted D.J. Chark with a step on his defender on a fade route, but the two were clearly not on the same page . Opportunity lost. ""I told them this one should sting,"" coach Dan Campbell said. ""We had a chance to win and we didn't make it, but I don't think this was a step backward. I'm frustrated, but we're getting better."""
2022,13,21,Green Bay Packers,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 19 Beating the Eagles on the road in prime time always seemed like a tall task for this flawed Packers team, but there was still the hope that Aaron Rodgers could summon some magic like he did two weeks earlier in an upset of the Cowboys. Instead, Green Bayâs paper tiger defense was sliced to bits by Jalen Hurts , and Rodgers left the game with an ominous oblique injury . Jordan Love led the Packers to 10 points in two possessions in the fourth quarter, a promising performance that begs the question whether Green Bay would be better off getting an extended look at the former first-round pick in whatâs become a lost season."
2022,13,22,Arizona Cardinals,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 Talk about a back-breaker. The Cardinals had a seven-point lead in the final minute of a game they absolutely had to have -- and ended up losing on a touchdown and two-point conversion with 15 seconds to go. Itâs just the latest chapter in a season of immense disappointment in the desert. ""We had our chances,"" Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury said . ""I think both teams played well enough to win. They made the plays at the end; unfortunately, we didn't. Our offense got it back twice -- went three-and-out -- can't do that against a good team."" Itâs notable that Kingsbury, the team's offensive play-caller, singled out that unit's failure in the final quarter rather than a defense that couldn't get a stop with the game -- and perhaps, season -- on the line."
2022,13,23,Jacksonville Jaguars,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 29 Jaguars fans will one day look back on Nov. 28, 2022, as the day Trevor Lawrence officially arrived as their franchise savior. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft had been making strides in recent weeks, but the QB took his game to another level in Sunday's dramatic 28-27 win over the Ravens. Lawrence threw for 321 yards and three touchdowns, capped by a scoring toss to Marvin Jones with 14 seconds to play and a gutsy two-point conversion strike to Zay Jones that stole a win from Baltimore and sent the crowd at TIAA Bank Field into hysterics. ""We've been on the wrong side of these a lot,"" Lawrence said. ""To win games like this, it's awesome. Nothing like it."""
2022,13,24,Pittsburgh Steelers,4-7,"Previous rank: No. 25 The Steelers might not make the playoffs, but this season will still feel like a success if they come out of 2022 confident that Kenny Pickett is their quarterback of the future. The first-round pick is on track to do just that after a solid performance in Monday night's 24-17 win over the Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium. After Indianapolis scored 14 unanswered points to take the lead in the third quarter, Pickett orchestrated an 11-play, 75-yard touchdown drive punctuated by a pretty two-point conversion pass to George Pickens to finish the scoring. Fun fact: The Steelers are 12-1 in their last 13 appearances on Monday Night Football ."
2022,13,25,Atlanta Falcons,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 20 Sometimes your season comes down to one play. Itâs too soon to say if Marcus Mariota âs final pass near the goal line at FedExField on Sunday will qualify as such for the Falcons, but it certainly felt like it after the deflected attempt was picked off by Kendall Fuller to seal a damaging loss to the Commanders. Atlanta again ran the ball with efficiency -- 167 yards on 29 carries -- but Washington was even better on the ground in a 176-yard effort. A surprise loss by the Bucs keeps the Falcons on the fringes of the NFC South race , but Arthur Smithâs team profiles as your classic also-ran. A competitive, respectable also-ran ... but an also-ran nonetheless."
2022,13,26,New Orleans Saints,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 You canât win if you canât score, and the Saints saw their fading playoff hopes take another hit in a dispiriting shutout loss to the 49ers in Santa Clara. Alvin Kamara lost two fumbles and New Orleans came up empty on two trips into the red zone, wasting a game effort by a Saints defense that cooled off a Niners attack which had entered Sunday on a roll. Kamara has now matched a career high with four fumbles, and the New Orleans running attack remains completely missing in action. Sundayâs leading rusher? Andy Dalton , who churned out 21 yards worth of scrambles. This is not a very good or disciplined team, and itâs fair to wonder if Dennis Allen will pay for it with his job."
2022,13,27,Indianapolis Colts,4-7-1,"Previous rank: No. 27 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Colts shook off a slow start to make a game of it on Monday night , but subpar play from a pop-gun offense didn't disappear when Frank Reich was served his walking papers . Matt Ryan 's lack of mobility and arm strength are obvious impediments here, but the Colts also lack playmakers they can count on aside from Michael Pittman Jr. and Jonathan Taylor , who didn't see many touches after a goal-line fumble on a failed exchange with Ryan in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Jeff Saturday absorbed his first real sideline criticism for some poor clock management on Indy's final doomed drive. ""I thought we had plenty of time,"" Saturday said afterward . ""I wasn't too concerned."""
2022,13,28,Carolina Panthers,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 31 We are very much here for Sam Darnold Redemption Szn (sorry, never again). The former first-round pick has had an unfulfilling NFL career to date, but he can solidify his future, make some money and even keep the Panthers in the NFC South race with a strong close to the season. Darnold threw a touchdown pass and accounted for another score with an end-zone recovery of his own fumble (listen, the man's had a weird career) in a 23-10 win over the Broncos. The Panthers have seen all they've needed to see with Baker Mayfield , so this should be Darnold's gig for the balance of the year, with P.J. Walker waiting in the wings if needed. Let's see if Darnold can make the most of his opportunity."
2022,13,29,Chicago Bears,3-9,"Previous rank: No. 23 When you take Justin Fields out of the mix, thereâs not much meat on the bone here. The Bears and their perpetually overmatched defense were carved up by Mike White and the Jets, who piled up 466 yards in a 31-10 wipeout at the Meadowlands. Trevor Siemian and the offense sputtered after a hot start, and it will be interesting to see how Chicago chooses to handle Fields moving forward. Fields -- the unquestioned cornerstone in Chicagoâs rebuild -- has a shoulder injury that makes him vulnerable, and the 2022 Bears are going nowhere. The good news: Chicago currently holds the No. 2 overall pick in next April's draft."
2022,13,30,Los Angeles Rams,3-8,"Previous rank: No. 28 Sunday's game against the powerhouse Chiefs was supposed to be one of the showdowns of the year in the NFL, but the Rams' rapid descent to the bottom of the NFC standings rendered the result -- a 26-15 win by Kansas City -- something of an afterthought. The Rams played without quarterback Matthew Stafford , who's dealing with a neck strain that leaves his availability for the balance of the season in doubt. The big question is where Stafford fits into the future of a Rams team that suddenly finds itself in a very different place than when Stafford arrived as a ""final piece"" in 2021. Stay tuned."
2022,13,31,Denver Broncos,3-8,"Previous rank: No. 30 The Broncos have the NFL's most disappointing offense, led by the league's most disappointing quarterback, Russell Wilson . It was more of the same Sunday, a 23-10 loss to the Panthers in which Denver managed just 246 yards against a Carolina team in the running for a top-five pick in the upcoming draft . Wilson has struggled in numerous ways this season, but his failures in the red zone are borderline surreal. According to ESPN's Bill Barnwell , Wilson's red-zone QBR has dropped from 91.9 during his final season in Seattle to 6.3 through 10 games with the Broncos. He went from being one of football's most efficient QBs inside the 20 for a decade, to the absolute worst. Wilson's struggles are quite literally hard to believe."
2022,13,32,Houston Texans,1-9-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 There's always one team that drags to the finish line just a little more hopelessly than the rest of the field. That, unfortunately, appears to be the fate of the Texans in 2022. Houston was down 30-0 by halftime against the Dolphins on Sunday , just the latest indignity for a one-win team that is less and less competitive by the week. Kyle Allen didn't do much in his first start in place of the benched Davis Mills , and the countdown is already on for which college hotshot QB Houston will select with the No. 1 overall pick in next April's draft. Up next is the Browns and the return of some quarterback named Deshaun. Make it stop."
2022,14,1,Philadelphia Eagles,11-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Eagles continue to prove themselves to be a tier above nearly every team in football. On Sunday, they took the Titans apart at the Linc, outgaining the AFC South leaders by nearly 250 yards in a 35-10 laugher . A.J. Brown went full Jefferson-against-Lincoln High mode in his Titans revenge game, piling up 119 yards and two touchdowns before telling reporters how personal this matchup truly was against his former team. ""It's been personal since the trade,"" he said. ""I was just trying to keep it down. That's where I wanted to be. Things just didn't work out. It was like here, we don't want you anymore."" Tennessee's big loss is Philly's massive gain."
2022,14,2,Dallas Cowboys,9-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Cowboys turned a nail-biter into a howler in the fourth quarter, scoring 33 unanswered points in the final 15 minutes -- checks notes -- yes, thirty-three unanswered points in the final fifteen minutes of a 54-19 pasting of the Colts on Sunday Night Football . Former Indy first-round pick Malik Hooker put the game away with a fumble-return score early in the final quarter, Dallasâ third defensive touchdown of the season. The Cowboys have now won five of six while averaging 39.8 points per game since Week 8. The Eagles remain atop the NFC East , but only a fool would count the Cowboys out of the race for the division and No. 1 seed. Americaâs Team is firing on all cylinders."
2022,14,3,Cincinnati Bengals,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 8 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Joe Burrow is The Truth. On Sunday, Bengals coach Zac Taylor asked his young quarterback to put a dagger through the heart of the mighty Chiefs on third-and-long in the final two minutes. Burrow happily obliged, delivering a perfect 14-yard strike to Tee Higgins that allowed Cincinnati to run out the clock on their fourth straight win and third victory over Kansas City in this calendar year. The Bengals currently sit in second in the AFC North because of their Week 5 loss to the Ravens , but thereâs little question which team feels more like a legitimate Super Bowl contender right now. So much of that goes back to the guy under center. When asked Sunday if he thinks his quarterback is playing at an MVP level, Taylor didn't hesitate : ""Absolutely. ... I wouldn't trade him for anybody in the world."""
2022,14,4,Buffalo Bills,9-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 Life without Von Miller started off in encouraging form for the Bills, who shut down a tepid Patriots attack during a prime-time win in Foxborough. Buffalo pressured Mac Jones on 39.5 percent of his dropbacks (the second-highest rate of the QB's career, according to ESPN ) and surrendered just 242 yards of total offense in the 24-10 conquest . With Miller's availability in doubt after his move to IR, it's essential that Buffalo gets impact play from its remaining pass rushers; Greg Rousseau and A.J. Epenesa both made an impact in their return to the lineup in Week 13. The victory, coupled with Sunday losses by the Dolphins and Chiefs, moved Buffalo from the fifth seed all the way to No. 1 in the AFC with five games to play. Nice little weekend! EDITOR'S UPDATE: Von Miller will miss the rest of the 2022 season due to a torn ACL, Bills coach Sean McDermott announced Wednesday."
2022,14,5,Kansas City Chiefs,9-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Chiefsâ hopes of landing the No. 1 seed in the AFC took a major hit Sunday with their 27-24 loss to the Bengals, the one team in the conference that appears to have Kansas Cityâs number. Thatâs three straight losses to Joe Burrow and Co. in the past calendar year; all taut, one-score affairs that ended with Cincy making the type of crunch-time money play that Kansas City has been known for during its extended run of greatness. With a favorable schedule, the Chiefs can still right the ship and nab the top seed and bye that comes with it â¦ but you wonder if some doubt has crept in when it comes to the team from Cincinnati."
2022,14,6,Minnesota Vikings,10-2,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Vikingsâ astounding success in one-score games (9-0) continued Sunday with another narrow win, this time a 27-22 conquest against a stubborn young Jets team. The Vikings won because their defense stood strong in the red zone, holding New York to one touchdown in six trips inside the Minnesota 20. You canât argue with the Vikingsâ record, but Kirk Cousins will need to play better if Minnesota is to be taken seriously as a Super Bowl contender. The veteran missed some layups against the Jets and continues to perform at levels below his career norms. Does that mean a hot streak is coming for one of the NFLâs most consistent producers? We wouldnât bet against it."
2022,14,7,San Francisco 49ers,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 3 The 49ers had their best win of the season on Sunday against the Dolphins, but it won't be remembered that way. Jimmy Garoppolo is done for the year after suffering a foot injury that will require surgery, a cruel twist of fate that left a dour Kyle Shanahan visibly dazed as he addressed the media during his postgame availability. It remains to be seen if Jimmy G's loss will serve as the death of San Francisco's title hopes, but there is some optimism to be found in the relief effort by Brock Purdy , who piloted the offense with surprising efficiency in his first career game action. If Purdy -- the final pick in the 2022 NFL Draft -- can get this team back to the Super Bowl, we have ourselves a movie script."
2022,14,8,Miami Dolphins,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 Sunday brought a sobering reality check for the Dolphins, who found the art of scoring points not quite so effortless when pitted against an elite opponent like the 49ers. Tua Tagovailoa connected on a 75-yard scoring strike to Trent Sherfield on the first play from scrimmage, but most of the QB's day was characterized by heavy pressure from San Francisco's talented front seven, along with surprising accuracy issues, in a 33-17 loss . Tua should be fine -- especially when his offensive line gets healthy -- but questions will persist about the tenacity of Miami's high-octane attack when facing the best defenses in football."
2022,14,9,Tennessee Titans,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Itâs been a humbling two weeks for the Titans, who went from everyoneâs darling after a prime-time win over the Packers to a reeling contender with troubling question marks following consecutive losses to the Bengals and Eagles . Tennessee was never competitive on Sunday, hopeless to stop Jalen Hurts and Phillyâs rolling offense, while Ryan Tannehill and a slumping Derrick Henry sputtered in drive after drive. Perhaps most concerning is the way the Titans have been beaten in the past two Sundays -- profiling as the less physical side in both contests. Itâs the antithesis of what Mike Vrabelâs teams have been about for years. Said the coach : âI think weâre at a crossroads in how we want to continue down this season.â"
2022,14,10,New York Jets,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 10 Itâs never boring with these Jets. Robert Salehâs team fell behind 20-3 in the first half to the host Vikings before putting together a second-half comeback that fell painfully short thanks to a waterfall of red-zone failures. New York went 1-for-6 inside the Minnesota 20, culminating with a last-gasp fourth-down pass by Mike White that was intercepted at the goal line in the final minute. A frustrating loss, no doubt, but the rising Jets again proved they can battle with anyone on their schedule. White, meanwhile, looks like the teamâs obvious answer at QB after another 300-yard performance with several big-time throws. Said star rookie wideout Garrett Wilson : âIâd go to war for that boy.â Get comfortable, Zach Wilson ."
2022,14,11,Baltimore Ravens,8-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 The Ravens escaped with a 10-9 win over the Broncos on Sunday, but the victory came at a significant cost. Lamar Jackson exited in the first half with a knee injury, and John Harbaugh acknowledged Monday that the center of Baltimore's universe will likely miss time as a result. ""I would say it's kind of week to week,"" the coach said of Jackson's availability. ""It's probably less likely for this week, but it's not impossible. And then after that, it'll become more and more likely."" If Jackson can't go on Sunday against the Steelers , backup Tyler Huntley will get the call as the Ravens attempt to keep pace with the surging Bengals atop the AFC North. If Jackson misses several weeks, we'll watch Baltimore free-fall out of playoff contention for the second consecutive December."
2022,14,12,Seattle Seahawks,7-5,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ When it's money time, Geno Smith will look for DK Metcalf . That's exactly what happened in the final minute on Sunday at SoFi Stadium, as the quarterback took the shotgun snap, drifted to his right, then fired a perfect dart to Metcalf, who snagged the game-winning touchdown with Jalen Ramsey all over him. It was just another clutch play in a season full of them for Geno. ""He may do it again next week,"" Metcalf said of Smith's heroics. ""He's been doing it ever since he got here. Whenever we put him in and ask him to carry the load of being a leader as a quarterback, he's done nothing but exceed expectations."" Geno's rise might be the NFL's most surprising success story in 2022."
2022,14,13,Washington Commanders,7-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 Taylor Heinicke isn't as naturally talented or consistent as you might want your starting quarterback to be, but then he hits a throw like we saw on Sunday with the game hanging in the balance at the Meadowlands, and you're reminded why the quarterback has endeared himself to so many Commanders fans. Heinicke's clutch fourth-down conversion to Curtis Samuel set up a game-tying touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson , and even a scoreless overtime period couldn't shake the feeling that these Commanders aren't going away in the NFC playoff chase . Up next: A long-awaited bye before a pivotal rematch with the Giants at FedExField."
2022,14,14,New York Giants,7-4-1,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Giants had multiple chances to close out the Commanders on Sunday but had to settle for a tie after Graham Gano 's 58-yard field goal attempt fell well short of the uprights on the final play of overtime. Had New York's defense made a final stand at the end of regulation, we'd be talking about the Giants rediscovering the spirit and resolve that defined the early portion of their season. Instead, this remains a team that, while still in playoff position, has just one win ( against the lowly Texans ) in the past six weeks. It doesn't get any easier this week against the Eagles before a rematch with the Commanders in their building. Big Blue is about to reach a fork in the road of its season."
2022,14,15,Las Vegas Raiders,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Riddle me this: How is it that the Raiders can have two legitimate Offensive Player of the Year candidates ( Davante Adams and Josh Jacobs ) and a leading contender for Defensive Player of the Year ( Maxx Crosby ), yet still find themselves two games under .500 after winning their third consecutive game? The answer: The Raiders are weird. The Raiders are weird as hell, man. Sunday's 27-20 conquest showed Josh McDaniels' squad in full bully mode against a Chargers team that was outclassed after jumping out to an early lead. We know Las Vegas is better than its record indicates ... but can these Raiders actually find their way back into playoff contention ? They can take another step in that direction with a win against the battered Rams on Thursday ."
2022,14,16,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 18 Tom Brady is 45 years old. There is no earthly reason he should still be able to lead the type of comeback we saw on Monday Night Football in Tampa, where the Buccaneers wiped out a 13-point deficit in the final five minutes to beat the rival Saints, 17-16 . The stunning effort reaffirmed the Bucs as the clear favorite to come out of the soggy NFC South while also reminding the football world that Brady might still have a special run in his bones if/when this team punches its ticket to the tournament. And if the game ends up meaning nothing in the big picture and Brady walks away after the season? Well, maybe we all got to see the G.O.A.T. do his thing one more time."
2022,14,17,Detroit Lions,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ This offense is for real. That was a clear takeaway as the Lions went up and down the field on the Jaguars in a 40-14 rout at Ford Field -- Detroit's fourth win in five games. The Lions have been scoring all season, of course, but the version of Ben Johnson's attack that we saw Sunday carried with it an air of long-term sustainability. There's more explosiveness in the mix when D'Andre Swift and Amon-Ra St. Brown are healthy, and strong protection up front has allowed Jared Goff to be the most efficient version of himself. After the dust cleared, Goff -- who played on some superpower Rams teams in an earlier NFL life -- called Sunday ""as complete a team win as I've ever been part of."" Dan Campbell is doing the damn thing."
2022,14,18,Los Angeles Chargers,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 12 Injuries continue to limit the Chargers during a time when they should be making their playoff push. On Sunday, Justin Herbert was under constant duress during a 27-20 loss to the Raiders in which the Bolts played without their starting left tackle, right tackle and center. It's not just the offensive line, either. Star pass rusher Joey Bosa (groin) remains sidelined without a timetable to return, while it's unclear if wide receiver Mike Williams will make it back following his latest high ankle sprain. It's fair to wonder if -- and perhaps time to admit that -- this is another year where the Chargers will look back at their roster in August, then compare it to what they finished with in January, and wonder aloud who they ticked off in a prior life."
2022,14,19,New England Patriots,6-6,"Previous rank: No. 15 The boo birds were once again out in Foxborough on Thursday night, as an ineffectual Patriots attack failed to keep up with the Bills in a deflating prime-time loss . Mac Jones â sideline outburst ( ""Throw the f---ing ball! The quick game sucks!"" ) revealed the criticism extends beyond the paying customers at Gillette Stadium. On Monday, Bill Belichick acknowledged the issues, while also explaining the impracticality of a factory reset in the middle of December. ""I think we need to do what we're doing better. I don't think at this point making a lot of dramatic changes -- it's too hard to do that,"" Belichick said on WEEI's The Greg Hill Show . Thatâs not what frustrated Patriots fans want to hear, but itâs probably as close as youâll get to a Belichick admission he miscalibrated his operation in this regard."
2022,14,20,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 19 Deshaun Watson made his Browns debut in Sundayâs 27-14 win over the Texans and looked ... very much like a quarterback who hadnât played a regular-season snap in 700 days. He routinely skipped passes into the turf at NRG Stadium and acknowledged after the win he profiles as a work in progress after serving a suspension for the first 11 games for violating the league's personal-conduct policy . ""It's not going to be perfect, especially playing in December football where guys are [in Week 13], and this is Week 1 for me,"" the QB said. Watson had less to say about the loud chorus of boos that rang out from what looked like a half-empty stadium -- his former home venue -- each time he came to the line of scrimmage on Sunday. Watsonâs new reality remains a complicated one."
2022,14,21,Green Bay Packers,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 After the two-point conversion that sealed a comeback win over the Bears, Aaron Rodgers delivered a military salute to all the fans at Soldier Field whoâd been giving him the one-finger salute for the previous 3.5 hours. Such is the nature of the relationship between the Green Bay QB and the Chicago fan base he continues to â own .â Rodgers wouldnât have gotten the last word without the help of Christian Watson , who continues his unlikely charge in the Offensive Rookie of the Year race. Watson scored through the air and on the ground , his eighth and ninth touchdowns in the past four weeks. The Packers need a miracle finish to return to the playoffs, but the sudden emergence of Watson gives the offense something to build on moving forward."
2022,14,22,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-7,"Previous rank: No. 24 You just know Mike Tomlin had to love how the Steelers closed out the Falcons on Sunday. Rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett connected on a second-down pass to Diontae Johnson to move the chains and bleed valuable time off the clock in the final two minutes. After three runs, special teams perfectly executed a punt to down the ball at the Atlanta 2-yard line. Then Minkah Fitzpatrick , playing the part of closer, snagged the interception to seal a gritty 19-16 win . With Pickett progressing and T.J. Watt back in the fold, the Steelers are poised to finish their transition season in optimistic fashion."
2022,14,23,Arizona Cardinals,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 Even during their bye, chaos and controversy seem to follow the Cardinals. Last week, former teammate Patrick Peterson used his podcast to put Arizonaâs QB1 on blast: â Kyler Murray donât care about nobody but Kyler Murray,â the Vikings cornerback said. âThatâs just a matter of fact.â Murray shot back at Peterson via social media, which prompted a response from the eight-time Pro Bowler , before the story mercifully drifted away. This isnât the first time Murrayâs leadership skills have been questioned, of course: Name another franchise quarterback whose own team felt compelled to challenge his work habits in contract-stipulation form ? Ultimately, Murray can quiet the doubters with his play on the field. He has five more games to do that this season."
2022,14,24,Jacksonville Jaguars,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 23 You can never get too satisfied with yourself in the NFL. The Jaguars were no doubt feeling confident after their dramatic Week 12 win over the Ravens , but Sunday served as a nasty hangover in the form of a relentless Lions attack that piled up 437 yards in a 40-14 blowout at Ford Field. Jacksonville's defense was completely overmatched, failing to force so much as a single punt in four quarters. When it was over, Doug Pederson offered a blunt assessment of his dazed team. ""We were kind of shocked to start the game,"" the coach said. ""We were not ready."" Pederson can only hope the embarrassing loss serves as a teachable moment."
2022,14,25,Atlanta Falcons,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 25 The Falcons operate an offense that relies heavily on the run, but no team can succeed in the modern NFL without the ability to move the ball through the air when necessary. Week after week, Atlanta has been hamstrung by its one-dimensional nature, and we saw that again in a frustrating 19-16 loss to the Steelers. The weak NFC South has remained up for grabs, which might explain why Arthur Smith has decided to stay with Marcus Mariota at quarterback to this point. With Atlanta's bye this week, though, it feels like the time to turn to rookie Desmond Ridder -- both for a spark in 2022 and a look at what the team might have for 2023 and beyond."
2022,14,26,New Orleans Saints,4-9,"Previous rank: No.  26 ""It sucks, it stings, it hurts."" That's how Dennis Allen summed up Monday's unthinkable collapse against the Bucs, a contest the Saints seemed to have in their back pocket before Tom Brady ripped a season-revitalizing victory away from the visitors from New Orleans. The Saints' defense had been dominant for so much of the game, but Brady's precision passing in crunch time -- coupled with a New Orleans offense that could not make a big play to bleed the clock and keep Brady off the field -- conspired to create one of the more deflating regular-season losses in recent memory. This is the kind of meltdown that can get people fired."
2022,14,27,Carolina Panthers,4-8,"Previous rank: No. 28 Baker Mayfield hit the scene in Carolina with plenty of fanfare, but he exits as just another failed experiment at the gameâs most important position for the Panthers. The veteran quarterback was waived Monday, ending an unproductive stay in Carolina that featured just one win in six starts for the former No. 1 overall pick. The move leaves Sam Darnold entrenched as Carolina's clear QB1 with P.J. Walker in a backup role. Barring a stunning career renaissance for Darnold, the Panthers are merely counting down the days until they can hopefully identify a quarterback of the future in the 2023 NFL Draft ."
2022,14,28,Chicago Bears,3-10,"Previous rank: No. 29 The Bears got Justin Fields back on Sunday, and with him, another electrifying highlight in the form of the young QBâs 55-yard rushing touchdown in the first quarter against the rival Packers. Unfortunately, a talent-deficient Bears defense was again exposed in Aaron Rodgers â latest conquest in Soldier Field. The bye week finally arrives for the Bears in Week 14, giving Chicago the chance to get healthy in the banged-up secondary while also providing Matt Eberflus and offensive coordinator Luke Getsy an opportunity to plot out how they want to close the season with Fields, who's playing with an injured non-throwing shoulder."
2022,14,29,Los Angeles Rams,3-9,"Previous rank: No. 30 Moral victories don't mean much in the NFL, but the Rams battled for four quarters against the Seahawks before Geno Smith 's dagger of a touchdown pass to DK Metcalf in the final minute sealed a 27-23 defeat for Los Angeles. John Wolford spread the ball around in a serviceable start in place of Matthew Stafford (moved to injured reserve with a neck issue), but L.A. lacks explosive playmakers, with Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson out of the lineup with injuries. One bright spot? Bobby Wagner , the veteran linebacker who had an interception against the Seahawks, his former team. Wagner believed he was joining a contender when he signed with the Rams last March -- now he's one of many veteran players whose futures feel uncertain, with an important offseason ahead in Los Angeles."
2022,14,30,Denver Broncos,3-9,"Previous rank: No. 31 The offensive struggles of the Broncos have long since entered the realm of the absurd. Sunday's 10-9 loss to the Ravens was more of the same sad story. Denver managed just 272 total yards against a Baltimore defense that was sliced and diced by Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars in the previous week . Russell Wilson was again completely ineffective, as the Broncos scored one touchdown or fewer for the 10th time this season. Whether Denver fans want it or not, Wilson's huge contract means he'll get another shot to redeem himself come 2023. It's becoming increasingly apparent rookie head coach Nathaniel Hackett might not be so fortunate."
2022,14,31,Indianapolis Colts,4-8-1,"Previous rank: No. 27 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jeff Saturday pop -- presupposing such a thing ever actually existed -- is no more for the Colts, who have reverted to the same hopelessly adrift operation they appeared to be before Frank Reichâs firing last month. Sunday nightâs 54-19 massacre at the hands of the Cowboys was bizarre, given the lopsided nature of a 33-0 fourth quarter, but also because -- prior to those final 15 minutes of carnage -- the Colts were very much alive and in position to register a massive upset. Until they werenât. On Monday , Saturday sounded like a coach ready to move some furniture around: âWeâre gonna look at everything.â We suggest not too closely, Jeff."
2022,14,32,Houston Texans,1-10-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 Texans fans served up loud boos for Deshaun Watson on Sunday, expressing their displeasure with the Browns quarterback who began the second half of his career as a visitor in the stadium once packed with fans who adored him. So much has changed since the final game of the 2020 season, and the Texans are still very much digging out from the wreckage caused by Watsonâs alleged misconduct , their internal reaction to those actions and the resulting blockbuster trade that sent the quarterback to Cleveland. The result of Sundayâs game -- a 27-14 loss -- was an afterthought: This game was less a competition and more like another hurdle this team needed to clear in its attempt to start over."
2022,15,1,Philadelphia Eagles,12-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 The punishing versatility of the Eagles' offense is a sight to behold. Nick Sirianni's team did whatever it wanted against an overmatched Giants defense, piling up 253 yards on the ground and 217 through the air in a 48-22 wipeout of Big Blue at the Meadowlands. Jalen Hurts ' magnificent season -- he's up to 32 total touchdowns against just five turnovers -- is worthy of NFL MVP honors, but a stellar year from Miles Sanders shouldn't be overlooked. The running back scored twice and set a career high with 144 ground yards against New York, and he's over 1,000 yards rushing with four games to play. The Eagles are going to beat you when they have the ball -- it's just a matter of how they choose to do it."
2022,15,2,San Francisco 49ers,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 There will be life after Jimmy Garoppolo for the 49ers. Perhaps even football immortality, come the second Sunday in February. Brock Purdy stepped into the starting lineup on Sunday and easily outplayed Tom Brady in a 35-7 win over the Bucs at Levi's Stadium. Purdy was a natural in Kyle Shanahan's offense, looking very similar to the hyper-efficient distributor Jimmy G had become in this attack before breaking his foot . Purdy will have to show he's more than a one-hit wonder, but his performance fuels legitimate optimism that San Francisco remains a serious title contender despite rotten injury luck at the game's most important position."
2022,15,3,Cincinnati Bengals,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 3 Joe Burrow' s greatness can be explained in part by how the Bengals can stay afloat so long as he is at the center of their world. Cincinnati lost wide receivers Tyler Boyd (finger) and Tee Higgins (hamstring) on their first possession on Sunday, but Burrow -- with a helping hand from fellow superstar Ja'Marr Chase -- was able to lift all boats in a 23-10 win over the Browns. The win allowed the Bengals to keep pace with the Ravens atop the AFC North while putting to bed the notion that Burrow couldn't beat Kevin Stefanski's Browns (the QB is now 1-4 lifetime against the coach). After the game, Burrow was quick to point out how well the Bengals are playing in all facets: ""We're just a complete team right now."""
2022,15,4,Buffalo Bills,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 With Von Miller out for the year , the Bills will need others to step up and fill the void of their ""closer."" Sunday's 20-12 win over the Jets was extremely encouraging from that perspective. Buffalo's front seven made life miserable for quarterback Mike White , who was punished for four quarters before leaving Highmark Stadium in an ambulance for precautionary tests . Greg Rousseau , A.J. Epenesa and Shaq Lawson combined for four sacks, and Buffalo forced two critical fumbles to seal another win. The D provided cover for an offense that continues to operate at a pedestrian level: The Bills punted on their first five possessions and were held to a season-low 232 yards. The opponent and weather conditions should be factored in, but there are issues to be resolved."
2022,15,5,Kansas City Chiefs,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 The Chiefs opened Sunday's matchup with the Broncos by scoring the game's first 27 points, including the latest absurd Patrick Mahomes TD pass for the Canton reel. Then ... things got weird. Mahomes threw an interception ... then another ... then one more , and Kansas City's defense was left to fight off an unlikely Denver rally. A late third-quarter scoring pass from Mahomes to JuJu Smith-Schuster provided some breathing room, and the improving Chiefs pass rush (season-high six sacks) finished things off. ""We beat them in the first half; they beat us in the second half,"" defensive end Frank Clark said . ""We just won the game. That's the perfect way to describe it."" Thank you."
2022,15,6,Dallas Cowboys,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Dak Prescott and the Cowboys woke up just in time against the Texans. After a goal-line stand by the defense, Prescott completed 6 of 7 passes and added two scrambles (including one for a first down) on a 98-yard drive that culminated with Ezekiel Elliott's 2-yard game-winning touchdown run with 41 seconds on the clock. The 27-23 win was dramatic, but barely finding a way to get past the one-win Texans tells the story of a Dallas team that needs to tighten things up. The remaining schedule is tough, starting with a road matchup against a fast-improving Jaguars team."
2022,15,7,Minnesota Vikings,10-3,"Previous rank: No. 6 The Vikings' quest to clinch the NFC North is on pause for another week. A trip to Ford Field proved to be as difficult as advertised for Kevin O'Connell's team, which struggled to slow a roaring Lions offense in a 34-23 loss . Kirk Cousins did his best to keep Minnesota alive, delivering on-target throws all afternoon in his best performance of the season. His top receiver? Justin Jefferson , of course, who piled up a franchise-record 223 yards on 11 catches. Still, questions will continue about this team as the defense continues to get torched regularly. Minnesota will enter Week 15 dead last in football in yards allowed. This is not the recipe for postseason glory."
2022,15,8,Baltimore Ravens,9-4,"Previous rank: No. 11 J.K. Dobbins returned just in time for the Ravens. Dobbins was back in the lineup for the first time since Week 6 and rushed for 120 yards on just 15 carries to help carry a banged-up Baltimore team to a gutty 16-14 road win over the Steelers. The Ravens triumphed despite the absence of Lamar Jackson (knee) and the loss of backup QB Tyler Huntley , who exited late in the third quarter with a concussion . The Ravens finished the game with undrafted rookie Anthony Brown under center and might be forced to roll with Brown on a short week against Cleveland . Expect a lot more Dobbins, no matter who's at quarterback."
2022,15,9,Los Angeles Chargers,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 18 You couldn't draw up a more rewarding win for head coach Brandon Staley. The Chargers' shorthanded defense befuddled Mike McDaniel's potent Dolphins attack, while Justin Herbert played at the peak of his powers in a 23-17 win that moved Los Angeles to the edge of playoff position with four games remaining. Herbert thoroughly outplayed Tua Tagovailoa , hitting on a collection of absurd throws that showed off his elite arm strength and accuracy. He also benefited greatly from the return of Mike Williams , his big-play wideout who dominated on the outside. Said a beaming Staley when it was over: ""It was an incredible team win."""
2022,15,10,Detroit Lions,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 17 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ These Lions are for real. Dan Campbell's team continued to roll the opposition on Sunday, this time piling up 464 yards on the NFC North-leading Vikings in a 34-23 win at raucous Ford Field. The offense is led by Jared Goff , who is playing quarterback at a very high level right now. The veteran threw for 330 yards and three touchdowns, and he has not tossed an interception in five weeks. Goff and Co. will face a stiff test with a Week 15 trip to the Meadowlands to face the Jets. If this offense proves it can travel against a tough defense in the elements, we'll be talking about a playoff team in Detroit come January."
2022,15,11,Miami Dolphins,8-5,"Previous rank: No. 8 Tua Tagovailoa is in an ill-timed funk. The Dolphins quarterback struggled mightily for the second consecutive game, a prime-time loss to the Chargers in which he was badly outplayed by fellow Class of 2020 alum Justin Herbert . Tagovailoa started with three completions in his first 17 attempts and continues to look out of sync with the rest of the Miami offense. The Dolphins are now 0-2 in December, and it won't get any easier, with a Week 15 matchup on tap in Buffalo. ""I would say the defenses that we've played have been playing exactly what we've expected them to play,"" Tagovailoa said of the two-game slump. ""It really just goes back to the details of how we play our offense, and we're not all dialed in with that."""
2022,15,12,New York Jets,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 No one will ever question Mike White 's toughness after Sunday. The quarterback was knocked from the game twice on crushing hits from Buffalo defenders, only to make his way back to the field each time. After the 20-12 loss , White left the stadium in an ambulance for a precautionary exam on his ribs. On Monday, Robert Saleh praised White's performance and expressed optimism the QB would be on the field for a pivotal Week 15 matchup against the surging Lions. The Jets have lost four of six with just two touchdowns in the past two games. This is a feel-good story that ends with disappointment (and more QB health concerns) if the offensive line can't be more competitive."
2022,15,13,New England Patriots,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Patriots went to Arizona and secured a win they absolutely had to have. As a result, New England will enter the final four weeks of the season in playoff position as the seventh seed in the AFC. The Pats beat the Cardinals because their defense delivered a dominant performance: The night turned on a Raekwon McMillan fumble recovery TD in the third quarter before Josh Uche and Matthew Judon (combined 4.5 sacks) put the game away with their relentless pursuit of Arizona backup Colt McCoy , who took the field after Kyler Murray's early knee injury . With a rugged schedule ahead, the Pats couldn't afford to let this one slip from their grasp. You could sense that urgency in a season-saving win."
2022,15,14,Washington Commanders,7-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 It's all in front of the Commanders now. The Giants were pasted by the NFC-leading Eagles in Week 14, putting Washington in position to leave New York in its dust in the wild-card standings with a win on Sunday night at FedExField. The Commanders officially made a depth-chart change ahead of the pivotal showdown, activating erstwhile starting QB Carson Wentz from injured reserve to serve as Taylor Heinicke 's backup. Said Ron Rivera of the QB pecking order: ""I feel comfortable with Taylor."" The decision was a no-brainer for the head coach. Heinicke is a popular player, both in the locker room and amongst the fanbase. Wentz can't be thrilled to lose his job because of injury, but his understudy took an opportunity and ran with it. That's football."
2022,15,15,Tennessee Titans,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 9 After a blowout loss to the Eagles in Week 13, Mike Vrabel told reporters the Titans were at a crossroads . On Sunday against the Jaguars, Tennessee looked like a team that has stumbled down a dark path to nowhere. The shorthanded defense was lit up by Trevor Lawrence , while the offense turned the ball over four times in a 36-22 drubbing by the Jaguars. Three consecutive losses, combined with last week's stunning dismissal of general manager Jon Robinson, paint the picture of a team in serious trouble. Said Vrabel: ""Nothing was good enough today."" The boo birds in Nashville that came out in force by the third quarter strongly agree."
2022,15,16,Seattle Seahawks,7-6,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Seahawks have lost three of four and don't look the part of a playoff contender as the season reaches its most critical juncture. Pete Carroll's defense -- so improved during a four-game winning streak at midseason -- has come apart in December and was run over by the Panthers for 223 ground yards in Sunday's damaging 30-24 loss . The defensive struggles and injuries at running back put too much pressure on Geno Smith to play at an MVP level on a weekly basis. Geno is one of the NFL's best stories this season, but it's unfair to ask him to carry the team like a superstar. It doesn't get any easier with the division-leading Niners coming to town on Thursday night ."
2022,15,17,Jacksonville Jaguars,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 24 Trevor Lawrence didn't play like a quarterback with a bum toe on Sunday. The second-year passer continued to build on his hugely encouraging sophomore season, throwing for 368 yards and three touchdowns in a 36-22 win over the reeling Titans in Nashville. Lawrence's top target was Evan Engram . Long an enigma during his time with the Giants, the tight end looked like a fully realized force in a monster 11/162/2 effort. The win moves Jacksonville within two games of Tennessee in the AFC South with four to play -- still long-shot odds , but a situation worth monitoring. Lawrence and Co. are peaking at the right time."
2022,15,18,Las Vegas Raiders,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 15 It's going to be hard to take the 2022 Raiders seriously after Thursday night, when they allowed Baker Mayfield to march 98 yards in 95 seconds without the aid of a timeout (or, presumably, any real knowledge of the Rams' playbook). The end result -- a grotesque 17-16 loss after leading 16-3 with less than four minutes to play -- snapped a three-game winning streak and likely ended any thoughts of a late playoff push . The Raiders have now blown four games this season in which they had a multi-score lead in the second half. This latest setback was the true debacle, however, one that could potentially be pointed to as a catalyst for change for an organization stuck in neutral."
2022,15,19,New York Giants,7-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 14 The Giants welcomed the Eagles into their building on Sunday and found out they weren't in the same weight class as the rampaging NFC East leaders. The obvious talent disparity between the two teams, made greater by a tidal wave of Big Blue injuries, gave the game a David-vs.-Goliath feel -- Philly dominated New York in all three phases and scored the game's first 21 points en route to a 48-22 win . Up next is a crucial Sunday night matchup against the Commanders with a wild-card spot possibly hanging in the balance. Not-so-fun fact: The Giants have not won a game in a month."
2022,15,20,Carolina Panthers,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Panthers are alive and well in the NFC South race after an impressive road win over the Seahawks. Sam Darnold played mistake-free football in his second start this season, but Carolina won the game behind a bruising rushing attack that bullied the Seattle front seven in crunch time. Chuba Hubbard and D'Onta Foreman combined for 148 of Carolina's 223 yards on the ground, and Raheem Blackshear put the game away with an 8-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter. The 5-8 Panthers control their destiny in the NFC South -- win out, and they host a playoff game in January. If they do that, Steve Wilks will have his interim label removed at his NFL Coach of the Year press conference."
2022,15,21,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-7,"Previous rank: No. 16 There appears to be no fixing this Bucs offense. Tampa Bay's attack remained a dysfunctional mess in Tom Brady 's much-ballyhooed Bay Area homecoming, a grisly 35-7 loss to the 49ers. Brady threw two interceptions and needed 55 passes to reach 253 yards through the air; the team's only touchdown came on a deflected goal-line pass snagged by Russell Gage late in the third quarter. The Bucs appeared to have a long touchdown from Brady to Mike Evans in the first quarter, but the latest back-breaking penalty by left tackle Donovan Smith wiped the points off the board and set the tone for another frustrating afternoon for the ""leaders"" of the NFC South."
2022,15,22,Green Bay Packers,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 Though still technically in playoff contention, the Packers already appear to have an eye on next year. That starts at the quarterback position with Aaron Rodgers , who will turn 40 next December. Asked about Rodgers' future during the bye week, GM Brian Gutekunst said the team ""surely"" wants the reigning MVP back -- while also leaving the door open for an alternate reality. ""We made a big commitment to him this offseason, so that was obviously something that was really important to us,"" he said of the three-year, $150 million contract Rodgers signed last March. ""But like we've talked about in the past, this is something we'll sit down with him after the season and it will be something we do together and move forward that way."" Hmmmm."
2022,15,23,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Deshaun Watson 's second start went better than his first, but he still has plenty of work to do to start resembling the $230 million QB the Browns paid for -- dearly, some would say -- in the offseason. Watson threw his first touchdown pass in 707 days on a connection to tight end David Njoku (the pair showing instant chemistry in their first action together), but that would be the only touchdown for Cleveland in a 23-10 loss to the Bengals. The Browns were stopped on three fourth-down attempts and were penalized nine times for 98 yards. With the playoffs a distant long shot , the rest of this season is about getting Watson back up to NFL game speed, with an eye on 2023."
2022,15,24,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Steelers had a faint pulse in the playoff chase after three wins in four weeks, but their chances of relevant January football likely died with Sunday's narrow loss to the Ravens at Acrisure Stadium. Kenny Pickett exited the game after a hard hit by Roquan Smith and is in the concussion protocol for the second time in as many months -- an ominous development. If Pickett misses time, Mitch Trubisky will step back into the starting lineup. The veteran provided some spark to the offense against Baltimore, but he also threw three interceptions. Get well soon, rookie."
2022,15,25,Atlanta Falcons,5-8,"Previous rank: No. 25 This was not the move that Arthur Smith wanted to make. The head coach made a quarterback switch during the bye week, swapping out ineffective veteran Marcus Mariota for rookie Desmond Ridder ahead of Sunday's gotta-have-it game against the Saints . The sad state of the NFC South has kept the Falcons in the playoff conversation even after four losses in five weeks, but Mariota's accuracy issues, failure to consistently lead the offense to points and a knee injury forced a pivot. Turning to a completely untested third-round pick in the middle of December is the type of gamble a team takes when it has no other recourse. Good luck, kid."
2022,15,26,Los Angeles Rams,4-9,"Previous rank: No. 29 This season will be remembered as an epic disappointment for the defending champions, but the Rams and their fans will always have that Thursday night game . The Baker Game. Baker Mayfield led Los Angeles on two touchdown drives in the final five minutes to crush the spirit of the Raiders and the tens of thousands of Silver & Black supporters who invaded SoFi Stadium for a presumed prime-time Bacchanalia. ""I don't know if you could write it any better than that,"" said Mayfield, claimed off waivers from the Panthers two days earlier. ""Obviously, we'd like to be a little bit more stress-free, but it's a pretty damn good story , I'll be honest with you."""
2022,15,27,New Orleans Saints,4-9,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Saints have already guaranteed their first losing season since 2016. The struggles will surely prompt big internal questions for the organization moving forward -- even as the unsightly nature of the NFC South as a whole keeps New Orleans (barely) alive in the division race. Dennis Allen might be coaching for his job in the final four weeks of the season. Then there's the quarterback position: Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill were previously identified as rightful successors to Drew Brees , but now both are on the bench in favor of Andy Dalton -- now several years deep into the ""veteran wanderer"" portion of his NFL life. Everything in the league starts with stability at coach and QB -- the Saints are wobbling in both categories."
2022,15,28,Chicago Bears,3-10,"Previous rank: No. 28 The rebuilding Bears entered the season with more rookies on their Week 1 roster than any team in football. The biggest surprise of the bunch through the bye week? Chicago-area native Jack Sanborn , an undrafted linebacker who has thrived since replacing Roquan Smith as the starting middle linebacker. Over the past month, Sanborn has largely equaled the production of Smith, who has thrived in his own right since his trade to the Ravens. ""Sometimes good football players are overlooked because their arms aren't 32 (inches) or their hands aren't 10 (inches) and you're not running 4.4 and all those things,"" defensive coordinator Alan Williams said last month . ""That doesn't mean you're not gonna be a really good football player. And so (Sanborn) transcends that."""
2022,15,29,Arizona Cardinals,4-9,"Previous rank: No. 23 A lost season in the desert reached rock bottom on Monday night against the Patriots . Kyler Murray crumpled to the turf on the third offensive play of the game with a non-contact knee injury that is feared to be serious , per NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport. Arizona had no choice but to trudge on after that devastating gut punch, but the team was undone by the same issues we've seen all season: too many penalties, sloppy execution and a general listless vibe that's come to define the Kliff Kingsbury era in Arizona. With Murray's status for this season and 2023 unknown, the Cardinals now exist in a suspended state of organizational uncertainty. UPDATE: Tests confirmed Tuesday that Kyler Murray tore his ACL during Monday night's loss to New England ending his season, Rapoport reported."
2022,15,30,Denver Broncos,3-10,"Previous rank: No. 30 Russell Wilson was down on the turf at Mile High, his day suddenly over in what had been his most productive performance of the season. It was a cruel twist for the embattled quarterback, who exited after sustaining a concussion in the fourth quarter at the opponent's 1-yard line with a dramatic comeback win within reach. ""He was stepping up and making plays and putting his body on the line, man,"" backup QB Brett Rypien said after the 34-28 loss to the division-leading Chiefs. ""We can say all we want, but we were 3-9 and they (were) 9-3, and the guy is battling his ass off to try to win the game. That, to me, is someone I want to follow."""
2022,15,31,Indianapolis Colts,4-8-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 The Colts got a bye week to sit with their embarrassing 54-19 prime-time loss to the Cowboys in Week 13. How pleasant. Interim coach Jeff Saturday started a new week with optimism -- claiming Indianapolis has ""four winnable games"" to close the season with matchups against the Vikings , Chargers , Giants and Texans . Expect Matt Ryan to take this team to the finish line if his body allows it. ""He has battled. He is a realist,"" Saturday said . ""We talked about it about Dallas and even about our game vs. Pittsburgh not being what we want, and I think he shoulders a lot of the burden."" Added the coach: ""If we are going to win, we need Matt playing his 'A' game."" Ryan hasn't had his ""A"" game in several years now, of course, but he still profiles as the best option in a lost year."
2022,15,32,Houston Texans,1-11-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans are still sitting on one win, but they haven't quit on their coach. Lovie Smith deployed a two-quarterback rotation against the Cowboys and nearly pulled off a huge upset before Houston let the game slip away in the final minutes. Davis Mills and Jeff Driskel each saw extensive action -- with Mills in a passing role and Driskel primarily serving as a runner -- while the Houston defense forced three turnovers, including two Dak Prescott interceptions. ""I liked what happened today,"" Smith said. ""We used the best options we had. We have to figure out how to finish."""
2022,16,1,Philadelphia Eagles,13-1,"Previous rank: No. 1 Sometimes it's just about taking care of business. The Bears put up more of a fight than expected but were still no match for a Philadelphia team that made the big plays when necessary in a 25-20 win at Soldier Field. Jalen Hurts threw two interceptions in a game for the first time this season, but otherwise kept his MVP credentials legitimate with three rushing touchdowns -- moving within one ground score of Cam Newton's single-season NFL record for QBs. On Monday, it was learned that Hurts suffered a shoulder sprain that could keep him out of the lineup for the Week 16 showdown with the Cowboys. Philly is now tasked with managing Hurts' health while attempting to lock up the top seed in the NFC. A delicate dance, for sure."
2022,16,2,San Francisco 49ers,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 2 Brock Purdy has been tested twice, and the rookie has aced both exams with flying colors. It's a best-case scenario for the 49ers, who initially profiled as would-be Super Bowl contenders ruined by bad injury luck after Jimmy Garoppolo was lost to a broken foot in Week 13. Instead, Purdy has kept the offense efficient and productive while the defense continues to squeeze the life out of its opponents. Geno Smith and the Seahawks found that out the hard way on Thursday , as the Seattle quarterback was sacked three times and hounded relentlessly by a savage San Fran pass rush. Winners of seven straight, the Niners are NFC West champs for the first time since 2019."
2022,16,3,Buffalo Bills,11-3,"Previous rank: No. 4 Saturday night's 32-29 win over the Dolphins in the snow at Highmark Stadium is exactly the type of high-stakes playoff tune-up this team needed. This season has sometimes felt like a chore for a Buffalo squad that has been ticketed for the AFC Championship Game since July. These Bills have navigated injuries, inconsistent offensive play and a significantly improved AFC East to place themselves on the verge of another division title and possibly the conference's No. 1 seed . And all of that was in peril if Josh Allen didn't get his team off the mat after a rough third quarter on Saturday. Allen and Co. closed strong in a comeback win that felt like a playoff dress rehearsal."
2022,16,4,Cincinnati Bengals,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 3 The Bengals spotted the Bucs the game's first 17 points on Sunday before taking Tom Brady 's team apart with clinical precision in a 34-23 comeback win in Tampa. The sluggish start by Cincinnati made the team's second-half surge all the more stunning: The Bengals forced four turnovers and Joe Burrow threw four touchdown passes, three of which ended scoring drives that were fewer than 40 yards in distance due to Tampa Bay's avalanche of mistakes. The win, coupled with a Ravens loss to the Browns on Saturday, gives the Bengals some cushion as they attempt to claim their second straight AFC North crown. It would not be wise to bet against this team."
2022,16,5,Kansas City Chiefs,11-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 The Chiefs continue to stack wins against lesser opponents, but their sloppiness with the football is an issue to keep an eye on. Kansas City coughed up two fumbles -- the team is now up to 10 lost fumbles on the season -- and the Chiefs needed overtime to turn away the 1-12-1 Texans on Sunday . Kansas City will enter Week 16 with a minus-6 turnover differential, a puzzling data point for an 11-3 Super Bowl contender. Like the Bills, the Chiefs sometimes feel like a superpower just grinding their way through the season ahead of the true test to come in January. Playing loose with the football is dangerous business, but K.C.'s ability to hit the accelerator when necessary is an uncommon gift."
2022,16,6,Dallas Cowboys,10-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Cowboys' Christmas Eve matchup with the Eagles lost some sizzle after a damaging 40-34 defeat to the Jaguars that likely locks Dallas into a wild-card path in the playoffs. The Cowboys have no one to blame but themselves: Mike McCarthy's team had a 27-10 lead on Jacksonville with less than six minutes to play in the third quarter, but the defense couldn't cool off a scorching Trevor Lawrence , and Dak Prescott threw two more interceptions, including the overtime pick-six that ended the game in stunning fashion. The Cowboys aren't playing very sharp football right now -- if they don't clean things up, this will be yet another year to feature a fast start and depressing finish."
2022,16,7,Detroit Lions,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Lions can win ugly, too. Dan Campbell's Grit Monsters went to the Meadowlands and struggled to break through against a stellar Jets defense ... until it mattered most . Facing fourth-and-inches at midfield with two minutes to play, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson ( his head coach stock going up by the week) called a brilliant misdirection play that resulted in a 51-yard touchdown for Brock Wright . The Lions have won six of seven with an opportunity to move into NFL playoff position if they can take out the Panthers on Sunday. ""A lot of these close games are starting to lean more toward us than them,"" said Jared Goff . ""That hasn't always been the case around here. We fully believe in each other and know that somebody's going to make a play to do something right."""
2022,16,8,Minnesota Vikings,11-3,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Vikings obviously have a sense of humor. They must know the football world has been in an ongoing debate about whether the team is a legitimate contender or an outright fraud -- it's the only possible explanation for falling behind the lowly Colts 33-0 at halftime on Saturday before mounting the greatest comeback in the 103-year history of the NFL. ""You just need five touchdowns,"" veteran cornerback Patrick Peterson told his offensive teammates at halftime. ""That's nothing."" The final touchdown came from Dalvin Cook , who nearly brought the roof down at U.S. Bank Stadium on the 64-yard screen-pass score with less than three minutes to play in regulation that set up Greg Joseph 's game-winner in overtime. Call them contenders, call them pretenders ... just don't call them boring."
2022,16,9,Los Angeles Chargers,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 9 After surrendering the game-tying touchdown in the final minute, the Chargers appeared destined for a tense overtime period with the Titans . Justin Herbert decided to skip all that drama. The ""social media quarterback"" drove Los Angeles 57 yards on three straight passes, the final completion a brilliant 35-yard dart on the move to Mike Williams that set up Cameron Dicker 's game-winning field goal in the final seconds. The Chargers are currently in the sixth seed in the AFC with a cake remaining schedule that includes the Colts, Rams and Broncos -- three have-nots with a combined record of 12-29-1. No excuses now."
2022,16,10,Miami Dolphins,8-6,"Previous rank: No. 11 Some games can be as encouraging as they are frustrating. The Dolphins let a fourth-quarter lead slip away in a 32-29 loss to the Bills in snowy Orchard Park, but Mike McDaniel's team also answered critics who said the Tua Tagovailoa -led offense would struggle against top competition in adverse conditions. Tua was actually better than his very good numbers indicate, regularly delivering on-target passes to his teammates -- even if they weren't always caught. Miami's chances of winning the AFC East are slim, but this can still be a very dangerous playoff team. The Fins just have to get there first."
2022,16,11,Jacksonville Jaguars,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Jaguars are for real. Doug Pedersonâs team wiped out a 17-point second-half deficit and walked off the Cowboys on Rayshawn Jenkins â dramatic pick-six in overtime. The 40-34 win served as the latest showcase for Trevor Lawrence âs sudden ascension to franchise star status, while also moving Jacksonville within a game of the death-spiraling Titans in an AFC South photo finish that no one saw coming. The Jaguars can put a tremendous amount of pressure on Tennessee with a prime-time win over the slumping Jets on Thursday Night Football . As for Lawrence: The 2021 No. 1 overall pick has a passer rating of 111.1 with 13 touchdown throws and one pick over his last five games, looking like one of the best quarterbacks in football during that stretch. Itâs all happening."
2022,16,12,Baltimore Ravens,9-5,"Previous rank: No. 8 The hope (prayer?) is that Lamar Jackson âs return to the lineup will signal the end of the offensive woes for the Ravens, who were kept out of the end zone in a sleepy 13-3 loss to the Browns. Baltimore continued to run the ball with authority (piling up 198 yards), but the passing attack remained moribund, an issue that predated Jacksonâs knee injury. âWe have to just have a better passing game, basically,â a frank John Harbaugh said after the loss. ""Itâs not a good enough passing game right now across the board to do the things that weâre hoping to do. So, that will be priority one.â"
2022,16,13,New York Giants,8-5-1,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Giants won their most important game of the year because their best player balled out , and their most promising rookie announced his arrival. A rejuvenated Saquon Barkley barreled over the Commanders' defense in a dominating display during New York's final scoring drive, and Kayvon Thibodeaux dominated the Commanders' offensive line and lived in the backfield in a 12-tackle effort that included a sack/fumble/recovery for a massive touchdown . New York's goal-line stand in the final minute was, ahem, helped along by outside forces , but the Giants got it done and put themselves in excellent position to end a long postseason drought. Kudos."
2022,16,14,New York Jets,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 12 The Jets continue to play competitive football every week ... but the wins have stopped coming. The latest setback was the hardest to swallow, a 20-17 loss to the Lions that badly damaged New York's chances of ending the NFL's longest playoff drought. The defense's failure to get one final stop was a stunner, but the story around this team remains the quarterback position. Zach Wilson threw two touchdown passes in an erratic start in place of injured QB1 Mike White . On Monday, Robert Saleh chose not to commit to the former No. 2 overall pick for Thursday's pivotal prime-time game against the Jaguars . From here, the reasoning appears obvious: Saleh (like the rest of the Jets' locker room) presumably wants White to lead the offense in a must-win scenario. The short week might not allow it. EDITOR'S UPDATE: Jets coach Robert Saleh announced Tuesday that Zach Wilson will start against the Jaguars."
2022,16,15,Washington Commanders,7-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 14 When it was over, the Commanders had every right to be frustrated . An illegal procedure penalty on Terry McLaurin wiped out a Brian Robinson TD in the final minute, and a subsequent fourth-down pass to Curtis Samuel was ruled incomplete despite compelling visual evidence that Samuel had been interfered with by Giants corner Darnay Holmes . Of course, the Giants could point to other moments in the game where the Commanders could have taken control and failed to do so, including the previous Washington possession that ended with a Taylor Heinicke fumble in the red zone. A confounding night all around for a Commanders team that just made its path to the playoffs a lot more difficult."
2022,16,16,Las Vegas Raiders,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 18 The Raiders, man. Derek Carr 's dramatic fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Keelan Cole was high theater, but Chandler Jones ' stunning lateral snatch-and-score as time expired qualifies as one of the most shocking plays in Silver & Black history. When the dust settled, the Raiders had secured a must-win in a season that seems to bring fresh absurdity each week. ""It's probably the most insane ending I've ever been a part of,"" said Josh McDaniels, aging like a two-term president in his first season as coach. ""We'll take it. We'll take it for sure."" We're now working under the assumption the Raiders will win out to make the playoffs before blowing a 64-0 lead in the Wild Card Round."
2022,16,17,Green Bay Packers,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Packers leaned on their backfield to take care of the Rams and stay alive in the NFC playoff race . Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon combined for 197 total yards and three touchdowns in a 24-12 win at freezing Lambeau Field. Green Bay's defense took care of the rest, silencing a depleted Los Angeles offense led by Baker Mayfield , who lacked any of the magic of his previous prime-time appearance against the Raiders. Green Bay needs to win out and get help to return to the postseason for the fourth consecutive year -- the uphill climb continues on Christmas Day in Miami."
2022,16,18,New England Patriots,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 13 Just an unfathomable finish for the Patriots, who kicked away a late lead in Vegas, then literally threw the game away on Jakobi Meyers ' doomed lateral taken to the house by Chandler Jones as time expired. (Jones, the former Patriot, stiff-arming Mac Jones into Middle-earth on the way to the end zone was an inspired insult-to-injury touch by the Football Gods.) After the game, the players involved took accountability for the horror that had transpired, but it remains stunning to watch a Bill Belichick team regularly beat itself with mental errors. Big changes could be coming to the Patriots -- The Big Question might be whether The Hooded One will be on board with them."
2022,16,19,Tennessee Titans,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 15 The free fall continues. The Titans battled to the end on Sunday, but watched their losing streak balloon to four after a 17-14 setback to the Chargers at SoFi. The Titans, once in total control of the AFC South, are suddenly just one game up on the surging Jaguars with three to play. Ryan Tannehill gutted through Sundayâs action on a bad ankle, and poor line play continues to undermine an offense that makes every yard earned feel like a World War I trench battle. âThe division is still there, but, personally, I could care less about that,â safety Kevin Byard said after the game. âIt donât look like weâre a team right now thatâs going to beat anybody, so weâve got to find a way to get back to work and beat Houston. Thatâs all we can really do at this point.â Eek."
2022,16,20,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 23 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Browns had the good fortune to face the Ravens without Lamar Jackson on Saturday and they made the most of it, holding Baltimore out of the end zone in a 13-3 win . Deshaun Watson connected with Donovan Peoples-Jones for his first touchdown pass at home as a Brown, but the QB otherwise remains very much a work in progress after his 700-day NFL layoff . The Cleveland defense -- such an issue for much of the year -- has significantly improved in recent weeks, but the Browns will need a Christmas miracle to be playing beyond Week 18 ."
2022,16,21,Seattle Seahawks,7-7,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Seahawks had an opportunity to get their season back on track on Thursday Night Football , but the same issues that have plagued the team in recent weeks popped up again in a damaging 21-13 loss to the 49ers. The running game remains absent behind Geno Smith , while the Seattle defense has returned to major-liability status after a midseason hot streak raised expectations. Throw in the loss of Tyler Lockett ( finger surgery ), and this suddenly feels like a season on the brink. âI donât know if I have all the right words, but, man, I just hate losing,"" Smith said postgame . ""I got to figure it out.â The Seahawks will try to stop the bleeding on Saturday in Kansas City ."
2022,16,22,Pittsburgh Steelers,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 24 You get the feeling that Mike Tomlin will eventually look back at this transition season in Pittsburgh and call it one of his most rewarding from a coaching perspective. Things could have been ugly as the Steelers quietly turned over their roster in a post-Big Ben era. Instead, Pittsburgh profiles as a young team that's steadily improving as a long season nears its conclusion. We were reminded that as the Steelers out-executed the Panthers on both sides of the ball in a 24-16 win in Charlotte. Mitch Trubisky played mistake-free football in place of Kenny Pickett (concussion), and the Steelers punished the Panthers on third down, finishing 12-for-16 in those situations. This won't be a playoff season in Pittsburgh, but the franchise reset is going according to plan."
2022,16,23,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 For one half, it looked like the Buccaneers, at long last, had found themselves. The defense was throttling Joe Burrow , Tom Brady had rediscovered his chemistry with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin , and Tony Romo was bathing the home team with effusive praise from the CBS broadcast booth. Then came halftime and, eventually, the hard reality that the Bucs are simply not a very good team. Tampa Bay turned the ball over four times in the second half and botched a fake punt run for good measure in an embarrassing 34-23 defeat . The weakness of the rest of the NFC South may allow the Bucs to clinch another division title -- but that doesn't mean we need to take them seriously."
2022,16,24,Carolina Panthers,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 20 The Panthers had a chance to catch the bumbling Bucs atop the NFC South ... and they let a golden opportunity slip through their fingers in a 24-16 loss to the Steelers. After the game, a frustrated Steve Wilks wanted to dispel any January fantasies. ""We've got to worry about trying to get ourselves right to win a football game,"" the interim coach said. ""I don't want anybody in this building talking playoffs."" Carolina lost because Pittsburgh succeeded at the things the Panthers usually do well: getting stops on defense and running the ball with authority. On Monday, Wilks announced Sam Darnold will remain the starter on Saturday against the Lions ."
2022,16,25,New Orleans Saints,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 27 The Saints are somehow, almost impossibly, still in the race for the NFC South title after a 21-18 win over the Falcons. The victory, coupled with a Bucs loss to the Bengals, moves New Orleans within one game of the division leaders with three games to play, though Tampa owns the tiebreaker thanks to a season sweep of New Orleans. (It's all so silly, but let's embrace it .) It's been a frustrating year for the offense, but the Saints have something in Juwan Johnson , a college wide receiver turned undrafted NFL tight end who scored twice on Sunday and set a career high with 67 receiving yards. The emergence of Johnson, paired with an extremely promising rookie campaign by wideout Chris Olave , gives New Orleans something to build on moving forward."
2022,16,26,Atlanta Falcons,5-9,"Previous rank: No. 25 So maybe that's why Arthur Smith was so hesitant to turn to Desmond Ridder ? The rookie quarterback looked quite green in a 21-18 loss to the Saints, tentative in the pocket on a 97-yard passing day. Ridder should improve as he adjusts to the pro game, but it will be a bumpy ride that likely takes Atlanta out of contention in the absurd NFC South. The biggest bright spot on offense Sunday? Running back Tyler Allgeier , who rushed for a career-high 139 yards and a touchdown on a gorgeous 8.2 yards per attempt. Cordarrelle Patterson continues to produce, but Allgeier now looks like the potential future of Atlanta's backfield."
2022,16,27,Los Angeles Rams,4-10,"Previous rank: No. 26 Baker Mayfield 's magic didn't travel to Green Bay, as the Rams' offense was ice cold in the sub-freezing temperatures of Lambeau Field in a 24-12 loss . Mayfield threw for just 111 yards with a touchdown and one interception, while the Rams' defense -- missing Aaron Donald for the second straight week -- struggled to stop a Packers running game built for the cold. With three games to play, the Rams are eliminated from playoff contention and have matched the highest loss total by any defending Super Bowl champion. This was not the history Sean McVay was hoping to make when L.A. began its title defense in September."
2022,16,28,Denver Broncos,4-10,"Previous rank: No. 30 ï»¿ï»¿ Russell Wilson was cleared from concussion protocol last week, but Nathaniel Hackett still opted to go with Brett Rypien at quarterback. It was probably a good idea. A fierce Arizona pass rush finished with seven sacks, including three from J.J. Watt . Undeterred, Rypien led the Denver offense on three touchdown drives in the second half of a 24-15 win . The offensive leader was Latavius Murray , who ran for 130 yards and a touchdown. A strong effort kicks off what likely will serve as the final evaluation for Hackett in his attempt to avoid a one-and-done fate."
2022,16,29,Chicago Bears,3-11,"Previous rank: No. 28 The Bears made the mighty Eagles earn it on Sunday, pushing the NFC East leaders to the brink in a narrow loss at Soldier Field. The game was competitive because the young Chicago secondary had one of its best weeks of the season: MVP candidate Jalen Hurts threw two interceptions and was held without a passing score for the first time since Week 5. On the other side of the ball, Justin Fields ran for 95 yards and joined Lamar Jackson and Michael Vick as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Not bad company for the third-year player."
2022,16,30,Arizona Cardinals,4-10,"Previous rank: No. 29 After the week from hell -- one in which Kyler Murray tore his ACL and general manager Steve Keim abruptly left the team to attend to personal matters -- it was perhaps encouraging to watch Kliff Kingsbury's group deliver a professional effort in a 24-15 loss to the Broncos. The defense was led by J.J. Watt , who had three of Arizona's seven sacks of Denver backup Brett Rypien . The 33-year-old Watt isn't the all-world game-wrecker he was during his prime in Houston, but he remains a disruptive force who's now just one half sack away from cracking double digits in that category for the first time since 2018. Canton awaits for Justin James."
2022,16,31,Indianapolis Colts,4-9-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 An unthinkable collapse by the Colts, who jumped out to a stunning 33-0 halftime lead over the Vikings on Saturday only to end up on the bad side of the biggest comeback in NFL history . Indianapolis helped Minnesota get back into the game with an extremely conservative second-half game plan that ultimately produced three points in the final two quarters and overtime. Not to be outdone, the defense was sliced and diced by Kirk Cousins , giving up 417 of Cousins' 460 passing yards -- and all four of his touchdown passes -- after the break. Weâd say this is the kind of loss that gets a head coach fired ... but the owner already flipped that emergency lever a month ago . This is a Colts season that needs to end."
2022,16,32,Houston Texans,1-12-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans continue to flirt with some serious upsets. In Week 14, Lovie Smith's team nearly took out the Cowboys in Big D. On Sunday, Houston pushed the mighty Chiefs to overtime at NRG Stadium. Given the fact that winning can only hurt the Texans' draft position, some fans might consider this play hard/lose barely as the optimal scenario at this stage. Smith isn't about that life , but he's right to take pride in a team that's still fighting as we approach late December. Will Texans management credit Smith for the team's fight -- or hold it against the coach that he has only coaxed one win out of a Houston team that's now been tied or ahead in seven games entering the fourth quarter? Stay tuned."
2022,17,1,San Francisco 49ers,11-4,"Previous rank: No. 2 The 49ers are a fully-formed death machine destroying everything in their way. The defense is led by Nick Bosa , who likely clinched NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors with a dominant performance in Saturday's 37-20 win over the Commanders. Bosa finished with two sacks and a forced fumble and now has a career-high 17.5 sacks with two games to play. Brock Purdy , meanwhile, is 3-0 as starter after another productive game that featured two long TD passes to George Kittle . ""He's just getting the ball to us,"" Kittle said. ""He's great with the football. He puts it on target. He allows guys to run with it."" This is exactly what Kyle Shanahan asks from his QB in this offense."
2022,17,2,Philadelphia Eagles,13-2,"Previous rank: No. 1 The Eagles delivered a competitive effort with Jalen Hurts sidelined on Saturday, but the Gardner Minshew -led offense was unable to close out the NFC East (and clinch the conference's No. 1 seed) with a 40-34 loss at Jerrah World. Star right tackle Lane Johnson was forced out of the lineup late in the game, and on Monday it was learned that Johnson will miss the rest of the regular season -- and perhaps more time -- after suffering an injury in his abdominal area. Replacing one of the game's elite tackles will be a major challenge for the Eagles, who are also waiting to see if Hurts (sprained shoulder) will be able to return to action on Sunday against the Saints ."
2022,17,3,Buffalo Bills,12-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ The Bills won in the trenches at frigid Soldier Field to clinch another AFC East title. Devin Singletary and James Cook combined for 205 rushing yards and two scores, while the Buffalo defense clamped down on Justin Fields , holding the 1,000-yard rushing quarterback to just 11 yards on the ground. The Bills coasted to the win in the second half, but keep an eye on Josh Allen 's propensity for making dangerous throws. The star QB threw two interceptions on Saturday and could have had at least two others if the Chicago defense had been more opportunistic. It's an area of Allen's game that needs to be cleaned up ahead of playoff football."
2022,17,4,Cincinnati Bengals,11-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 A very strange Christmas Eve for the Bengals, who dominated an overmatched Patriots team in the first half, then needed a New England red-zone fumble in the final minute to escape with a 22-18 win at Foxborough. Cincinnati safety Vonn Bell forced the Rhamondre Stevenson fumble that sealed the victory, which keeps the Bengals in the hunt for the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. Cincy needs to get better results on the ground to keep the offense balanced: The Bengals averaged just 3.0 yards per attempt on 24 carries against the Pats after averaging 2.5 yards per carry in Week 15's win over the Bucs. Depth on the offensive line will be tested with the news that right tackle La'el Collins is out for the year with a torn ACL."
2022,17,5,Kansas City Chiefs,12-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 The Chiefs played clean football in Saturday's workmanlike 24-10 win over the Seahawks at Arrowhead. It's a welcome change for a team that hasn't always been on top of its game, even as it has continued to win. The offense finished without a turnover for the first time since Week 5, while a young K.C. defense yielded few big plays to Geno Smith and Co. ""I mentioned it the other way the last couple of weeks, that they need to get better,"" Andy Reid said of his defense. ""They're making progress and I thought they did a nice job today."" Kansas City can still claim the No. 1 seed in the AFC with two wins and a loss by the Bills."
2022,17,6,Dallas Cowboys,11-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Cowboys fell behind by double-digits early on Saturday against the Eagles , but a relentless offense and opportunistic defense ensured the fight for the NFC East will continue for at least one more week. Dak Prescott shook off a first-quarter pick-six to put up a stellar performance (three touchdown passes and 9.9 yards per attempt), and CeeDee Lamb delivered a true No. 1 WR effort with 10 catches for 120 yards and two scores. One mystery to unlock: What has happened to the Dallas pass rush? The Micah Parsons -led unit has one sack in the past three weeks after being shut out by Philly's offensive line."
2022,17,7,Minnesota Vikings,12-3,"Previous rank: No. 8 While doubters keep wondering when regression will take hold, the Vikings keep winning. Minnesota triumphed in yet another one-score game on Saturday, getting a walk-off 61-yard field goal from Greg Joseph to beat the Giants, 27-24 . Joseph got his chance thanks to Justin Jefferson , whose 17-yard catch-and-run in the final minute moved the ball into Giants territory and capped another dominant day from a player who absolutely deserves to be in the MVP conversation. The Vikings are 11-0 in one-score games this season, and Jefferson has been in the middle of the action during every crucible moment. A true difference-maker."
2022,17,8,Los Angeles Chargers,9-6,"Previous rank: No. 9 The Chargers are in the playoffs for the first time in the Justin Herbert era. Monday's 20-3 win over the Colts was far from a thing of beauty, but the Bolts deserve credit for taking care of business and removing any anxiety ahead of the final two weeks of the regular season. (This was hardly presumed, given the sordid history of the franchise in similar situations.) Austin Ekeler scored two more touchdowns, and the Los Angeles defense held a tepid Colts attack to just 173 total yards with seven sacks (a season high for the Bolts), three interceptions and zero first downs allowed on 10 third-down conversion attempts. If the Chargers can get both sides of their game synced up, they will be a very tough out in January."
2022,17,9,Jacksonville Jaguars,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 11 Jacksonville remains on the come-up. The Jaguars looked like the better, more prepared team in the wind and rain of the Meadowlands on Thursday night, coasting to a 19-3 win -- their first prime-time road victory in 22 years. Trevor Lawrence easily outplayed Zach Wilson in a showdown of the top two overall picks of the 2021 NFL Draft, while the improving Jags defense allowed a single field goal on a drive that started deep in their own territory. Now tied in the standings with the lifeless Titans, Jacksonville feels like a team destined to win the AFC South. What a difference a year makes."
2022,17,10,Baltimore Ravens,10-5,"Previous rank: No. 12 Get well soon, Lamar Jackson . That feels like the general vibe around the Ravens after a 17-9 win over the Falcons that featured more subpar play by the offense. Ty Huntley has led Baltimore on just two touchdown drives in three weeks despite getting significant help from a ground game that continues to produce. Jackson is the X-factor of the Baltimore attack, and the Ravens will need the former MVP healthy and performing at a high level if they want to be serious Super Bowl contenders. With a playoff spot secured , it will be interesting to see how John Harbaugh manages his quarterback ahead of the postseason."
2022,17,11,Detroit Lions,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 7 The Lions came down to Earth in grim fashion on Saturday, run over by a relentless Panthers attack in a 37-23 loss in Charlotte. The tone was set in the first drive as Chuba Hubbard and D'Onta Foreman ran through truck-sized holes in Detroit's front seven. When it was over, the Lions had surrendered 320 ground yards and 570 yards overall (both Panthers records). It was a terrible look for Aaron Glenn's defense, which needs to flush this effort and get ready for Justin Fields and the Bears on Sunday . ""That was a hungry team that we played,"" Dan Campbell said of the Panthers. ""And we didn't look as hungry. That's the bottom line."""
2022,17,12,Green Bay Packers,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 17 The Packers aren't going away. Green Bay went to Miami and kept its playoff hopes intact with a 26-20 win , powered by a defense that stepped up in crunch time. Jaire Alexander , De'Vondre Campbell and Rasul Douglas all had interceptions in successive Miami possessions in the fourth quarter, a stunning turn of events after the Packers surrendered 20 points in the first half. The offense remained efficient even after breakout wide receiver Christian Watson exited at halftime with a hip issue . Watson's availability will be crucial for a team that has come to rely upon the rookie's big-play ability during its winning streak."
2022,17,13,Miami Dolphins,8-7,"Previous rank: No. 10 The Dolphins entered Sunday with a chance to take firm control of a playoff spot, but let it slip away in a 26-20 loss to the Packers. Tua Tagovailoa threw interceptions to end three consecutive drives in the fourth quarter, dooming Miami to its fourth consecutive defeat. While a postseason berth remains within reach , Monday's news that Tagovailoa is in the NFL's concussion protocol only further clouds the immediate outlook for this team. Given the QB's previous time in the concussion protocol this season, it would not be surprising if he's held out of at least this weekend's critical matchup with the Patriots. If Tua misses time, the team's playoff hopes will rest in the hands of Teddy Bridgewater , winless in his limited appearances this season."
2022,17,14,New York Giants,8-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 13 Getting beat on a 61-yard field goal at the gun is a helpless way to go out, but Brian Daboll's team could have triumphed at U.S. Bank Stadium with better execution in the final quarter. A dropped interception, a pick from Daniel Jones and a blocked punt all came back to haunt the Giants in a 27-24 loss to the Vikings. Jones was excellent overall, completing 30 of 42 passes for 334 yards, while Saquon Barkley added another entry to his Comeback Player of the Year dossier, bursting through a stacked box on fourth-and-2 to score the touchdown that set up the dramatic 2-point conversion to tie the game late. The Giants can still clinch a playoff berth with a win over the lowly Colts on Sunday ."
2022,17,15,New York Jets,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 14 Zach Wilson had the chance to silence doubters with a strong showing in prime time against the Jaguars. Instead, he authored a performance that could seal his fate with the organization. Wilson was dreadful in a 19-3 loss to the Jaguars, benched in favor of Chris Streveler , a fourth-string quarterback who had been on the practice squad days earlier. On Monday, it was reported Mike White (ribs) has been cleared by team doctors and will start Sunday's do-or-die road contest against the Seahawks. It's possible Wilson, who was benched for a second time this season, has already started his final game with the Jets."
2022,17,16,Washington Commanders,7-7-1,"Previous rank: No. 15 Ron Rivera pulled the trigger on Saturday, benching Taylor Heinicke in favor of Carson Wentz in a 37-20 loss to the 49ers. Heinicke is a fiery competitor but also plainly inconsistent, and his struggles in the red zone might have been the final straw for Rivera, who will likely stay with Wentz in the final two weeks of the regular season. Now the Commanders must hope that Wentz can overcome the hot-and-cold style of play that has defined most of his own career. A sour end to the season under center could prompt a complete reboot at the position in the offseason. UPDATE: Wentz will start for Washington in Week 17, the team announced Wednesday."
2022,17,17,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 The Steelers will enter the new calendar year in playoff contention in the AFC, a huge victory for Mike Tomlin and Co. Pittsburgh continued its strong surge to the finish line with a 13-10 win over the Raiders on the night the late Franco Harris' No. 32 was retired . Kenny Pickett checked another box in his quest to be seen as The Guy in Pittsburgh, leading the Steelers on a 76-yard drive in the final minutes that culminated with the go-ahead touchdown pass to breakout rookie George Pickens . A win over the Ravens would put the Steelers in position for a playoff return. Who would have guessed that back in November?"
2022,17,18,New England Patriots,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 18 That's consecutive stomach-punch losses for the Patriots, who saw their playoff hopes take a hit with a 22-18 defeat to the Bengals at Foxborough. Rhamondre Stevenson -- whose lateral flip to Jakobi Meyers set up the infamous Chandler Jones TD in Week 15 -- fumbled on the Bengals' 8-yard line in the final minute to snuff out what could have been a dramatic comeback win for the Pats, who were down 22-0 at the half. New England still has a path to the postseason , but the self-inflicted errors are killing a team that is finding new and inventive ways to lose."
2022,17,19,Carolina Panthers,6-9,"Previous rank: No. 24 The Panthers manhandled the previously red-hot Lions in Charlotte, piling up a franchise-record 320 rushing yards in a 37-23 win . Carolina had more than 100 ground yards within its first two possessions and piled up 240 by halftime in a game that featured wide-open running lanes for D'Onta Foreman and Chuba Hubbard . The blowout win was an emphatic bounceback effort for a Carolina team that managed just 21 rushing yards in Week 15's loss to the Steelers . The NFC South is likely on the line in Sunday's showdown with the division-leading Bucs."
2022,17,20,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 23 Listen, it's never going to be pretty with these Bucs; every game is a grind. We saw it again in Sunday's 19-16 overtime win over a Cardinals team playing its third-string quarterback. Tampa Bay trailed by 10 points in the fourth quarter before a Tom Brady touchdown pass was followed by a William Gholston fumble recovery that allowed the Bucs to tie the game. Brady salvaged an uneven day with six straight completions in overtime before Ryan Succop won it with a 40-yard field goal . The NFC South hangs in the balance in Sunday's matchup against the Panthers. Don't expect a shootout."
2022,17,21,Las Vegas Raiders,6-9,"Previous rank: No. 16 A frustrating, sometimes-incomprehensible season for the Raiders moved closer to an unfulfilling conclusion on Saturday night with a 13-10 loss to the Steelers. Derek Carr's third interception of the game was the nail in the coffin, and it's fair to wonder how many more passes Carr will throw for the Silver & Black moving forward. With playoff hopes on life support , it's not crazy to think the Raiders might want to see what they have in Jarrett Stidham ahead of a potential trade of Carr in the offseason. It feels like big changes are afoot in the desert."
2022,17,22,Seattle Seahawks,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 21 Life without Tyler Lockett started poorly for the Seahawks, who punted on four of their first five possessions (the other ended via turnover on downs) in a 24-10 loss to the Chiefs on a brutally cold afternoon at Arrowhead. On the positive side, Kenneth Walker III broke out of a personal slump with his first 100-yard game since Week 9. Five losses in six games took the Seahawks out of the NFC West race, but a playoff spot is still within reach . Any hope at a course correction must begin with a win over the slumping Jets on Sunday at Lumen Field."
2022,17,23,New Orleans Saints,6-9,"Previous rank: No. 25 The Saints are still alive in the NFC South after squeaking out a 17-10 win over the Browns that served as a battle against both the opponent and the elements in frigid Cleveland. Taysom Hill and Alvin Kamara both scored on the ground and the New Orleans defense made a final red-zone stand, helped by some butterfingers -- or, perhaps frozen fingers -- by Cleveland pass catchers in and around the end zone. The Saints have won two straight for the first time this season, but the real test is just ahead with a road matchup against the mighty Eagles . Dennis Allen's team could catch a break if Jalen Hurts (shoulder) is forced to miss another week."
2022,17,24,Tennessee Titans,7-8,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Titans are in deep, deep trouble. On Saturday, the season reached a low point with a loss to a Texans team that entered action with one win. Malik Willis provided little spark to the offense starting in place of an injured Ryan Tannehill (ankle), and even Derrick Henry -- a running back who has mercilessly bullied the Texans in the past -- was held to just 3.5 yards per carry outside his 48-yard score in the first quarter. The Titans can still win the AFC South, but it might be more probable they don't win another game this season. The vibes around their Thursday Night Football matchup against the Cowboys are not good."
2022,17,25,Los Angeles Rams,5-10,"Previous rank: No. 27 Baker Mayfield delivered another fine effort for the Rams on Sunday, completing 24 of 28 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns in a 51-14 drubbing of the Broncos at SoFi Stadium. Mayfield led an unstoppable Los Angeles attack that never punted and scored on every drive other than the final series, which ended with a Mayfield kneeldown. The key question: What does this mean in the big picture? Matthew Stafford said last week he plans to return in 2023, but Mayfield will surely want to test the market for another starting job if he continues this strong finish. Mayfield in a backup role behind Stafford would be a huge win for the Rams entering next season."
2022,17,26,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Browns' playoff hopes died Saturday in fitting form -- a frustrating one-score loss that came down to a lack of execution in the game's most important moments. Deshaun Watson led the Browns to just one touchdown drive in miserably cold conditions, but that doesn't tell the whole story: Amari Cooper slipped and was unable to catch a surefire touchdown pass in the first half, while Donovan Peoples-Jones and David Njoku both failed to come up with potential touchdown catches on accurate Watson throws during Cleveland's final drive. The last two weeks become fully about getting Watson up to speed ahead of 2023 and beyond."
2022,17,27,Houston Texans,2-12-1,"Previous rank: No. 32 The Texans have played competitive football all month. On Saturday, they finally got credited with a win for their efforts. Lovie Smith's defense allowed just 272 yards and forced three turnovers in the 19-14 win over the Titans, Houston's first victory in over two months. Derrick Henry had dominated this rivalry with a slew of 200-yard games, but the dynamic running back was mostly contained outside of his 48-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Smith could make a real case for another year on the sideline if Houston can finish the season with two more strong efforts."
2022,17,28,Atlanta Falcons,5-10,"Previous rank: No. 26 The Falcons' chances to win the undercooked NFC South evaporated in a 17-9 loss to the Ravens that eliminated Atlanta from playoff contention . The Falcons have a lot of work to do to contend in a meaningful way, and that starts with identifying a solution behind center. Desmond Ridder 's second start went much better than his first, and he'll get two more opportunities to pitch himself for the 2023 starting job. Given his status as a third-round pick in a ""weak"" quarterback draft class, it would not be surprising to see the Falcons aggressively target another option in the offseason."
2022,17,29,Chicago Bears,3-12,"Previous rank: No. 29 Facing a stout Bills defense keyed to stop his scrambling and playing with a wide receiver group thinned out by injuries, Justin Fields had nowhere to go on Saturday at the ice box also known as Soldier Field. The result was a 35-13 loss to Buffalo that served as another reminder of how much work Chicago must do to get on the level of the best teams in football. Fields aggravated his left shoulder injury and got his foot stepped on during the loss, but Matt Eberflus dismissed the idea of shutting down the young quarterback for the final games of the season. "" Absolutely not ,"" the coach said."
2022,17,30,Arizona Cardinals,4-11,"Previous rank: No. 30 Trace McSorely vs. Tom Brady wasn't as one-sided as you'd expect. The Cardinals' defense did fine work against the G.O.A.T., holding a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter before letting another victory slip away in a 19-16 overtime loss . The game swung when running back Keaontay Ingram fumbled a pitch from McSorley with less than five minutes to play, a turnover that allowed Tampa Bay to tie the game with a field goal. With no Kyler Murray on the field, it's extremely difficult to evaluate much on the Cardinals' offense right now. The uncertainty surrounding Kliff Kingsbury's future only compounds the unease in the desert."
2022,17,31,Indianapolis Colts,4-10-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 This will all be over soon. The Colts played another prime-time game on Monday and once again looked the part of an overmatched mess in a 20-3 loss to the Chargers at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Indy defense did its part to keep things competitive, but the Colts' offense, led by an inept Nick Foles , was unable to get much going. Foles threw three interceptions by the end of the night, the type of performance that typically gets a declining veteran a ticket for the bench. It's not quite that simple for the Colts, who have already benched current backup Sam Ehlinger and former starter Matt Ryan ( twice! ). A reminder that Jeff Saturday signed up for this."
2022,17,32,Denver Broncos,4-11,"Previous rank: No. 28 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The wheels came all the way off for the Broncos on Christmas Day in an embarrassing 51-14 loss to the Rams that served as a final straw for new ownership. On Monday, Nathaniel Hackett was fired after less than a season on the job, a necessary move for a team that knows major changes are necessary to get the Broncos back on the right path. Monday's decision means Russell Wilson will operate under a new coach and new offense in what could be a make-or-break Year 2 for the embattled QB. Wilson was a mess on Sunday, throwing three interceptions before a meaningless touchdown drive in the fourth quarter. The Broncos average 15.5 points per game, their lowest since 1971 (14.5 points per game). Hackett deserves blame for the intense struggles, but Wilson's sudden decline cannot be ignored."
2022,18,1,San Francisco 49ers,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 1 Nick Bosa did it again. A week after bolstering his Defensive Player of the Year candidacy with a game-wrecking performance against the Commanders , Bosa pressured Jarrett Stidham into an overtime interception , ultimately allowing the 49ers to squeeze past the Raiders and extend their winning streak to nine. The defense made the play in crunch time, but it was also an off day for the typically dominant unit, as Vegas rolled up 500 yards of offense. This feels like more of a blip on the radar than cause for alarm, but it would be nice to see the Niners get back to their stingy ways in their final regular-season tune-up against the Cardinals . San Francisco can still claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win and an Eagles loss to the Giants on Sunday."
2022,18,2,Buffalo Bills,12-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Buffalo entered Monday night as a Super Bowl contender at the highest level. How the team proceeds from a competitive standpoint is a complete unknown as we move forward. What we do know is that this is a very tight locker room led by an excellent coach and leader in Sean McDermott. And Thursday morning's update that Damar Ha mlin ""has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours"" and ""appears to be neurologically intact"" lifts the spirits of everyone following this harrowing incident. EDITOR'S UPDATE: Damar Hamlin had his breathing tube removed overnight and ""continues to progress remarkably in his recovery,"" the Bills announced Friday , per the physicians at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Hamlin delivered a message to the team Friday morning and spent time talking to various teammates on FaceTime, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported."
2022,18,3,Cincinnati Bengals,11-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals deserve much praise for how they've handled everything connected to Damar Hamlin and the awful events of Monday night at Paycor Stadium. The team was immediately supportive of the Bills, and we've seen the same thing from a city pulling for Hamlin and his ongoing recovery. Cincy was on fire with passion to knock off the Bills on Monday night -- by Tuesday night, the skyline was bathed in Buffalo blue in a showing of unity. ""It's bigger than football,"" Zac Taylor said in his first public comments on Wednesday. ""I think Cincinnati and Buffalo are similar in that way and what the communities are about."""
2022,18,4,Kansas City Chiefs,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 When the Chiefs said goodbye to Tyreek Hill in a blockbuster trade last spring, it created very real questions about who would step up to replace the explosive Pro Bowler as a touchdown threat in Kansas City. The answer? Jerick McKinnon , obviously. The veteran running back -- re-signed on the eve of training camp -- had two scoring receptions in Sunday's 27-24 win over the Broncos and now has seven TD catches since Week 13, more than any player in football in that span. (Yes, the power of Patrick Mahomes is prominently at play here.)"
2022,18,5,Philadelphia Eagles,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Eagles missed another chance to clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC , doomed by a slow start and a late Gardner Minshew pick-six in a 20-10 loss to the Saints. Philadelphia's offense was nearly invisible in the first half, managing just 61 total yards and failing to register a first down until 12 seconds remained in the second quarter. The attack perked up after halftime, but it's clear Philly lacks an explosive element without Jalen Hurts at the controls. On the plus side, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Monday that Hurts (shoulder) is expected to be back in the lineup for Sunday's regular-season finale against the Giants , who just locked up the No. 6 seed and could rest starters."
2022,18,6,Dallas Cowboys,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 It was a take-care-of-business game for the Cowboys, who easily handled a short-handed Titans team resting multiple players in a Thursday Night Football snoozer. The only real competitive intrigue in the contest came via self-inflicted errors by Dak Prescott , who threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in a sloppy first half. Prescott and the rest of the offense cleaned it up from that point, coasting to the win in the team's third game in 12 days. A victory over the Commanders in Week 18 coupled with an Eagles loss to the Giants would allow the Cowboys to steal the NFC East -- along with, if you throw in a 49ers loss to the Cardinals, the conference's No. 1 seed. It's an unlikely scenario, but it still behooves Dallas to end the regular season playing good football."
2022,18,7,Los Angeles Chargers,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 8 It doesn't feel like Austin Ekeler quite gets his due. Let's try to rectify that a bit right here: Austin Ekeler is a do-it-all superstar, and the Chargers would be lost without him. The sixth-year running back scored two more touchdowns in Sunday's 31-10 win over the Rams (giving him a league-high 18 total scores on the season) and also went over 100 receptions (becoming the only running back to reach the century mark so far this season). He is Los Angeles' jack of all trades on offense and as consistent a performer as you'll find in the sport right now. Fantasy owners shouldn't be the only ones singing this man's praises."
2022,18,8,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jaguars kept the train rolling in the most efficient way possible, jumping out to an early lead over the lowly Texans before coasting to a 31-3 win ahead of Saturday night's AFC South-deciding showdown with the Titans . It couldn't have played out better for Doug Pederson, who was able to pull Trevor Lawrence and other key players from the lineup in the second half. A win over the free-falling Titans will give the Jaguars just the second AFC South title in franchise history. If they handle their business on Saturday night, the Jags profile as a potential underdog berserker in the AFC playoffs. One step at a time, of course."
2022,18,9,Green Bay Packers,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ The Packers are on the doorstep of the playoffs after their fourth consecutive win, and the team's surge is not all about Aaron Rodgers . While the offense has found its footing during this run of success, it's the sudden rise of the previously disappointing defense that has changed the feel of this team. Joe Barry's side of the ball registered four turnovers in a blowout of the Vikings , one week after Green Bay picked off Tua Tagovailoa on three consecutive fourth-quarter possessions to seal a win on Christmas Day. A victory over the Lions on Sunday night punches Green Bay's ticket to the playoffs for the fourth straight year under Matt LaFleur. It would be a remarkable achievement for a team that was once 3-6 and riding a five-game losing streak."
2022,18,10,Detroit Lions,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Lions dusted themselves off after a humbling loss to the Panthers and took out their frustrations on the poor Bears, who didn't stand a chance in a 41-10 blowout at Ford Field. It was Detroit's eighth game with 30-plus points this season, a franchise record. The explosive Lions rank fourth in scoring thanks in large part to big seasons from Jared Goff , Amon-Ra St. Brown , Jamaal Williams and an elite offensive line, but in order to punch their first postseason ticket since 2016, they still need a win on Sunday against the surging Packers and a Seahawks home loss to the Rams . With apologies to the 12s, I think it's safe to say the general public is pulling for the underdog Lions to make the tourney."
2022,18,11,Minnesota Vikings,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ The Vikings are like The Alliance of Magicians headed by G.O.B. in Arrested Development , posing for a goofy group photo while holding a sign that reads ""We Demand To Be Taken Seriously."" Twelve wins and a division title cannot be ignored, but it's hard to credibly view the Vikes as Super Bowl contenders when their season is littered with gnarly blowout losses like the 41-17 takedown we witnessed on Sunday at Lambeau Field. Minnesota suffered meltdowns in every phase of the game and generally looked like the clearly inferior team despite the records of the parties involved.

2022,18,12,Baltimore Ravens,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Ravens showed once again on Sunday night they do not close out teams at a championship level. This time it was the rival Steelers, who marched to the go-ahead touchdown in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter in a painful 16-13 loss for the home team at M&T Bank Stadium. The defeat underscores growing questions about how seriously this squad can be taken as a contender in the AFC. Late-game issues notwithstanding, the defense remains solid, but this offense is not good enough with Ty Huntley behind center. The uncertain status of Lamar Jackson (knee) hangs over this team like a dark storm cloud. EDITOR'S UPDATE: On Friday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh ruled Lamar Jackson out of Sunday's game against the Bengals."

Daniel Jones played his best game of the season in a blowout of the Colts , accounting for four total scores before exiting the game in the fourth quarter to chants of his name from the celebrating faithful at MetLife Stadium. ""Hearing his name get chanted, it's a beautiful thing,"" Saquon Barkley said, per NorthJersey.com . ""You can finally see he's starting to get the respect that he earns."" Barkley has been the driver of the Giants' offense for most of the season, but Jones' growth under Coach of the Year candidate Brian Daboll has been a huge development for the franchise.

Apparently, those were the three words uttered by Mike Tomlin to Kenny Pickett seconds after the rookie quarterback led the Steelers on the second late go-ahead touchdown drive in as many weeks in a dramatic prime-time win over the rival Ravens . Pickett has made strides over the course of his first season and shows poise not usually seen from a young QB. It makes him a snug fit for a Pittsburgh team that -- with its T.J. Watt -led defense and improving running game -- needs a quarterback who can run the offense in a smart and efficient manner. It's extremely promising to see Pickett already at this place in his development. And stunningly, given the 2-6 start to the season, the Steelers can still make the playoffs with a home win over the Browns and some outside help."

After months of misfires and near misses, the two stars were locked in when it mattered most, connecting on three long touchdowns in a 30-24 win over the Panthers that clinched a second straight NFC South title for Tampa Bay. Evans couldn't be covered by the Carolina secondary, finishing with 207 yards on the day and going over the 1,000-yard receiving mark for the ninth consecutive season. Brady and his alpha wideout are back in sync, making the Bucs a more compelling playoff entrant. ""We've battled through a lot of tough things this year,"" Brady said . ""Happy to win the division. It's always tough to do it. NFL games are tough to win, and we always figure out a way to keep them somehow exciting. I wish they wouldn't be as exciting as we made them."""

2022,18,17,New England Patriots,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 18 Nobody really needs to see this particular Patriots team in the playoffs, but they might just get there to spite us. Led once again by a wildly opportunistic defense, the Pats remain in the playoff race after a 23-21 win over the Dolphins in Foxborough. Breakout safety Kyle Dugger had the biggest play of the game, a third-quarter pick-six that put New England ahead for good against its struggling AFC East rival. It was Dugger's third touchdown of the season and the Pats' seventh defensive score of the year. It's not unfair to surmise that this would be an 11- or 12-loss Patriots team if not for the impeccably timed heroics of the non- Mac Jones side of the ball."
2022,18,18,Carolina Panthers,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Panthers had it all in front of them. Carolina was up 14-0 in the first quarter and 21-10 early in the fourth, but turnovers, combined with repeated coverage breakdowns around Mike Evans (three touchdowns, 207 yards receiving), were too much to overcome in a 30-24 loss to the Bucs. Tampa Bay wins another NFC South title , and Carolina is left to ponder how this game might have been different if star cornerback Jaycee Horn hadn't been sidelined by wrist surgery . The Panthers will finish out the season with a matchup against the Saints -- it's a game that means very little in the standings but could have a big impact on ownership's ultimate decision on interim coach Steve Wilks."
2022,18,19,Las Vegas Raiders,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 21 In the end, the Raiders delivered a season that was Vegas to the core: They ultimately lost, but everyone was entertained. Jarrett Stidham replaced Derek Carr in the starting lineup and delivered an extremely promising debut in an overtime defeat to the mighty 49ers, throwing for 365 yards and three touchdowns against the NFL's best defense. Stidham looked completely at home in Josh McDaniels' offense, and you can imagine the Raiders will think long and hard about giving the 26-year-old a shot at the starting job in 2023 if he can deliver a similar performance in Saturday's finale against the Chiefs . This feels like a very real late-season ""audition"" for the QB."
2022,18,20,Miami Dolphins,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Dolphins' 2022 season by result: W, W, W, L, L, L, W, W, W, W, W, L, L, L, L, L. The absurd symmetry is hard to look at for Miami fans, who got sucked in by this team twice before a five-game losing skid. The Fins can salvage their season and punch their playoff ticket with a home win over the similarly free-falling Jets on Sunday and a Patriots loss in Buffalo , but quarterback chaos continues to follow the team. Tua Tagovailoa (in the concussion protocol) is unlikely to be an option , and the availability of Teddy Bridgewater is in doubt after he suffered a finger injury Sunday. It is fair to wonder if seventh-round rookie Skylar Thompson is ready for this. EDITOR'S UPDATE: On Friday, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Skylar Thompson will start against the Jets."
2022,18,21,New York Jets,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 15 ""We feel like we blew the season."" Garrett Wilson spoke regretfully about Sunday's 23-6 loss to the Seahawks, which eliminated the Jets from postseason contention , but the rookie wide receiver's lament is applicable across a five-week stretch of misery for Gang Green, whose league-worst playoff drought has now extended to 12 years. The Jets were flat in all phases in Seattle, while Mike White 's much-anticipated return to the lineup resulted in a season-worst performance. White is not the future at quarterback for the Jets, and neither is Zach Wilson -- it places the star-crossed franchise in an all-too-familiar position as another postseason-less January begins."
2022,18,22,Washington Commanders,7-8-1,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Commanders are going home after the Week 18 finale in large part because of continued instability at quarterback. Ron Rivera's decision to turn to Carson Wentz backfired on Sunday, as Wentz threw three interceptions in a loss to the Browns that eliminated Washington from playoff contention. Rivera turned to Wentz because of Taylor Heinicke 's inconsistency, and now he looks to rookie Sam Howell , who has yet to play a regular-season snap, to start Sunday. Depending on how the fifth-rounder plays in his debut, the Commanders might be best served by a reboot at the game's most important position. It remains to be seen if Rivera will still be connected to the operation when that all-important QB decision is made -- this could be an offseason of change at every major level of the organization."
2022,18,23,New Orleans Saints,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 23 Welcome back, Marshon Lattimore . The veteran cornerback was in the lineup for the first time since October and made the play of the game on Sunday, a pick-six of Gardner Minshew in the fourth quarter that clinched a 20-10 upset win over the Eagles at the Linc. It capped an excellent overall performance by the Saints, who will fall short of their goal to reach the playoffs but are playing their best football of the season. This is good news for Dennis Allen, who was seemingly on the hot seat when New Orleans hit its bye week at 4-9. The Saints can end their season on a four-game winning streak by getting past the Panthers on Sunday ."
2022,18,24,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 26 If the final weeks of the regular season are indeed just a platform for Deshaun Watson to find his game after nearly two years away from real live action, consider Sunday's 24-10 win over the Commanders a big step in the right direction. Watson started slow but came on strong against Washington, leading Cleveland on three consecutive touchdown drives to take control of the game in the second half. Said Watson after the win: ""That was definitely the potential of what the future can hold."" That was the idea the Browns had when they made the decision to get into business with the controversial quarterback."
2022,18,25,Tennessee Titans,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 24 The result of Thursday's Week 17 matchup against the Cowboys counted about as much as a preseason game, so Tennessee used the prime-time contest to rest starters and get a look at Joshua Dobbs at quarterback. Dobbs delivered a more competitive effort than we've seen in limited action from Malik Willis and will make his second straight start in Week 18's winner-take-all matchup against the Jaguars . It's hard to imagine the Titans halting their late-season slide at this point -- this is a roster in need of significant work in the offseason -- but the NFL's decision to schedule the game on Saturday night may give the team an advantage against a Jacksonville team on short rest."
2022,18,26,Los Angeles Rams,5-11,"Previous rank: No. 25 The good vibes of a Christmas Day blowout of the Broncos didn't carry over to a lopsided loss to the playoff-bound Chargers on Sunday at SoFi Stadium, but the Rams have to be encouraged by the strong close from Cam Akers . The running back, whose time with the team seemed all but over in the weeks leading up to the trade deadline, rushed for 123 yards against the Bolts and has back-to-back 100-yard games heading into Sunday's finale against the Seahawks. The Rams -- who have now lost more games than any defending champion in the Super Bowl era -- will take any positives they can find."
2022,18,27,Atlanta Falcons,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 28 The evaluation of Desmond Ridder continues. The rookie quarterback has yet to throw a touchdown pass in three starts, but he did secure his first win as a starter when Younghoe Koo booted a last-second field goal in Sunday's 20-19 conquest over the Cardinals. Ridder was smart with the football and showed some good accuracy on deep balls, even if they didn't end in completions. It remains likely that Atlanta will be active in the quarterback market this offseason, but Ridder can give the team something to think about if he can deliver a strong performance in the season finale against the Bucs ."
2022,18,28,Denver Broncos,4-12,"Previous rank: No. 32 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Perhaps it can be seen as an encouraging sign that two of Russell Wilson 's best starts this season came against the mighty Chiefs, including a mostly solid effort in Sunday's 27-24 loss at Arrowhead. Wilson threw a touchdown pass and ran for two scores; he also made a few head-scratching decisions under pressure, an ugly recurring trait during Denver's hugely disappointing season. Credit to interim coach Jerry Rosburg for having the Broncos ready to play after the blowout loss to the Rams and subsequent firing of Nathaniel Hackett . Big changes are coming in Denver."
2022,18,29,Chicago Bears,3-13,"Previous rank: No. 29 There have been reasons for optimism around the Bears in the second half of the season -- mostly due to the rise of Justin Fields -- but Sunday's pummeling at the hands of the rival Lions shows how far this team remains from relevance. Chicago got run out of the building at Ford Field, allowing over 500 yards in a 41-10 loss that keeps the Bears in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. Fields went over 100 yards on the ground once again, but also had one of his worst passing days, completing just seven of 21 attempts for 75 yards while absorbing seven sacks from the league's No. 32-ranked defense. Fields is ruled out for Chicago's season finale against Minnesota due to a hip injury, so it's backup Nathan Peterman getting the start."
2022,18,30,Arizona Cardinals,4-12,"Previous rank: No. 30 A cursed Cardinals season took one more step to its merciful conclusion with a 20-19 loss to the Falcons. Quarterback David Blough stepped into the lineup on short notice and performed admirably after Colt McCoy developed concussion symptoms late in the week. If the journeyman plays well in Sundayâs season finale against the Niners (good luck with that), he could give himself a chance to compete for a backup spot on the roster next summer. That may also depend on Kliff Kingsbury still being the head coach next summer -- a very real question in the present moment."
2022,18,31,Houston Texans,2-13-1,"Previous rank: No. 27 After a commendable run of competitive December games, including a Week 16 win over the Titans , the Texans came down to Earth in a 31-3 loss to the Jaguars. Despite its league-worst record, much is on the line for Houston in Week 18 : With a loss to the Colts, the Texans clinch the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. A win at Indy, coupled with a Bears loss to the Vikings , would move Chicago into the top spot. It also remains to be seen if Lovie Smith is coaching his last game with the team. If Houston brass does decide to move on, it will make it two coaches in two years who were given no real chance to build the program."
2022,18,32,Indianapolis Colts,4-11-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 One more to go. Arguably the most turbulent season in franchise history is nearly over after another lopsided loss , this time at the hands of the Giants at the Meadowlands. Nick Foles â second start of the season was also his last , after he was sacked by Kayvon Thibodeaux and exited the game with an injured rib. On Monday, interim coach Jeff Saturday criticized Thibodeaux's â tasteless â sack celebration as well as the offensive line for not immediately coming to the defense of its quarterback, who was in clear pain while Thibodeaux did his tacky snow-angel routine right next to him. The ugly storylines are on infinite scroll in Indy."
2022,19,1,San Francisco 49ers,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 1 Nick Bosa did it again. A week after bolstering his Defensive Player of the Year candidacy with a game-wrecking performance against the Commanders , Bosa pressured Jarrett Stidham into an overtime interception , ultimately allowing the 49ers to squeeze past the Raiders and extend their winning streak to nine. The defense made the play in crunch time, but it was also an off day for the typically dominant unit, as Vegas rolled up 500 yards of offense. This feels like more of a blip on the radar than cause for alarm, but it would be nice to see the Niners get back to their stingy ways in their final regular-season tune-up against the Cardinals . San Francisco can still claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win and an Eagles loss to the Giants on Sunday."
2022,19,2,Buffalo Bills,12-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Buffalo entered Monday night as a Super Bowl contender at the highest level. How the team proceeds from a competitive standpoint is a complete unknown as we move forward. What we do know is that this is a very tight locker room led by an excellent coach and leader in Sean McDermott. And Thursday morning's update that Damar Ha mlin ""has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours"" and ""appears to be neurologically intact"" lifts the spirits of everyone following this harrowing incident. EDITOR'S UPDATE: Damar Hamlin had his breathing tube removed overnight and ""continues to progress remarkably in his recovery,"" the Bills announced Friday , per the physicians at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Hamlin delivered a message to the team Friday morning and spent time talking to various teammates on FaceTime, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported."
2022,19,3,Cincinnati Bengals,11-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals deserve much praise for how they've handled everything connected to Damar Hamlin and the awful events of Monday night at Paycor Stadium. The team was immediately supportive of the Bills, and we've seen the same thing from a city pulling for Hamlin and his ongoing recovery. Cincy was on fire with passion to knock off the Bills on Monday night -- by Tuesday night, the skyline was bathed in Buffalo blue in a showing of unity. ""It's bigger than football,"" Zac Taylor said in his first public comments on Wednesday. ""I think Cincinnati and Buffalo are similar in that way and what the communities are about."""
2022,19,4,Kansas City Chiefs,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 When the Chiefs said goodbye to Tyreek Hill in a blockbuster trade last spring, it created very real questions about who would step up to replace the explosive Pro Bowler as a touchdown threat in Kansas City. The answer? Jerick McKinnon , obviously. The veteran running back -- re-signed on the eve of training camp -- had two scoring receptions in Sunday's 27-24 win over the Broncos and now has seven TD catches since Week 13, more than any player in football in that span. (Yes, the power of Patrick Mahomes is prominently at play here.)"
2022,19,5,Philadelphia Eagles,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Eagles missed another chance to clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC , doomed by a slow start and a late Gardner Minshew pick-six in a 20-10 loss to the Saints. Philadelphia's offense was nearly invisible in the first half, managing just 61 total yards and failing to register a first down until 12 seconds remained in the second quarter. The attack perked up after halftime, but it's clear Philly lacks an explosive element without Jalen Hurts at the controls. On the plus side, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Monday that Hurts (shoulder) is expected to be back in the lineup for Sunday's regular-season finale against the Giants , who just locked up the No. 6 seed and could rest starters."
2022,19,6,Dallas Cowboys,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 It was a take-care-of-business game for the Cowboys, who easily handled a short-handed Titans team resting multiple players in a Thursday Night Football snoozer. The only real competitive intrigue in the contest came via self-inflicted errors by Dak Prescott , who threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in a sloppy first half. Prescott and the rest of the offense cleaned it up from that point, coasting to the win in the team's third game in 12 days. A victory over the Commanders in Week 18 coupled with an Eagles loss to the Giants would allow the Cowboys to steal the NFC East -- along with, if you throw in a 49ers loss to the Cardinals, the conference's No. 1 seed. It's an unlikely scenario, but it still behooves Dallas to end the regular season playing good football."
2022,19,7,Los Angeles Chargers,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 8 It doesn't feel like Austin Ekeler quite gets his due. Let's try to rectify that a bit right here: Austin Ekeler is a do-it-all superstar, and the Chargers would be lost without him. The sixth-year running back scored two more touchdowns in Sunday's 31-10 win over the Rams (giving him a league-high 18 total scores on the season) and also went over 100 receptions (becoming the only running back to reach the century mark so far this season). He is Los Angeles' jack of all trades on offense and as consistent a performer as you'll find in the sport right now. Fantasy owners shouldn't be the only ones singing this man's praises."
2022,19,8,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jaguars kept the train rolling in the most efficient way possible, jumping out to an early lead over the lowly Texans before coasting to a 31-3 win ahead of Saturday night's AFC South-deciding showdown with the Titans . It couldn't have played out better for Doug Pederson, who was able to pull Trevor Lawrence and other key players from the lineup in the second half. A win over the free-falling Titans will give the Jaguars just the second AFC South title in franchise history. If they handle their business on Saturday night, the Jags profile as a potential underdog berserker in the AFC playoffs. One step at a time, of course."
2022,19,9,Green Bay Packers,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ The Packers are on the doorstep of the playoffs after their fourth consecutive win, and the team's surge is not all about Aaron Rodgers . While the offense has found its footing during this run of success, it's the sudden rise of the previously disappointing defense that has changed the feel of this team. Joe Barry's side of the ball registered four turnovers in a blowout of the Vikings , one week after Green Bay picked off Tua Tagovailoa on three consecutive fourth-quarter possessions to seal a win on Christmas Day. A victory over the Lions on Sunday night punches Green Bay's ticket to the playoffs for the fourth straight year under Matt LaFleur. It would be a remarkable achievement for a team that was once 3-6 and riding a five-game losing streak."
2022,19,10,Detroit Lions,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Lions dusted themselves off after a humbling loss to the Panthers and took out their frustrations on the poor Bears, who didn't stand a chance in a 41-10 blowout at Ford Field. It was Detroit's eighth game with 30-plus points this season, a franchise record. The explosive Lions rank fourth in scoring thanks in large part to big seasons from Jared Goff , Amon-Ra St. Brown , Jamaal Williams and an elite offensive line, but in order to punch their first postseason ticket since 2016, they still need a win on Sunday against the surging Packers and a Seahawks home loss to the Rams . With apologies to the 12s, I think it's safe to say the general public is pulling for the underdog Lions to make the tourney."
2022,19,11,Minnesota Vikings,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ The Vikings are like The Alliance of Magicians headed by G.O.B. in Arrested Development , posing for a goofy group photo while holding a sign that reads ""We Demand To Be Taken Seriously."" Twelve wins and a division title cannot be ignored, but it's hard to credibly view the Vikes as Super Bowl contenders when their season is littered with gnarly blowout losses like the 41-17 takedown we witnessed on Sunday at Lambeau Field. Minnesota suffered meltdowns in every phase of the game and generally looked like the clearly inferior team despite the records of the parties involved. The doubts will follow this team into the postseason."

The Jets were flat in all phases in Seattle, while Mike White 's much-anticipated return to the lineup resulted in a season-worst performance. White is not the future at quarterback for the Jets, and neither is Zach Wilson -- it places the star-crossed franchise in an all-too-familiar position as another postseason-less January begins."
2022,19,22,Washington Commanders,7-8-1,"Previous rank: No. 16 The Commanders are going home after the Week 18 finale in large part because of continued instability at quarterback. Ron Rivera's decision to turn to Carson Wentz backfired on Sunday, as Wentz threw three interceptions in a loss to the Browns that eliminated Washington from playoff contention. Rivera turned to Wentz because of Taylor Heinicke 's inconsistency, and now he looks to rookie Sam Howell , who has yet to play a regular-season snap, to start Sunday. Depending on how the fifth-rounder plays in his debut, the Commanders might be best served by a reboot at the game's most important position. It remains to be seen if Rivera will still be connected to the operation when that all-important QB decision is made -- this could be an offseason of change at every major level of the organization."
2022,19,23,New Orleans Saints,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 23 Welcome back, Marshon Lattimore . The veteran cornerback was in the lineup for the first time since October and made the play of the game on Sunday, a pick-six of Gardner Minshew in the fourth quarter that clinched a 20-10 upset win over the Eagles at the Linc. It capped an excellent overall performance by the Saints, who will fall short of their goal to reach the playoffs but are playing their best football of the season. This is good news for Dennis Allen, who was seemingly on the hot seat when New Orleans hit its bye week at 4-9. The Saints can end their season on a four-game winning streak by getting past the Panthers on Sunday ."
2022,19,24,Cleveland Browns,,"Previous rank: No. 26 If the final weeks of the regular season are indeed just a platform for Deshaun Watson to find his game after nearly two years away from real live action, consider Sunday's 24-10 win over the Commanders a big step in the right direction. Watson started slow but came on strong against Washington, leading Cleveland on three consecutive touchdown drives to take control of the game in the second half. Said Watson after the win: ""That was definitely the potential of what the future can hold."" That was the idea the Browns had when they made the decision to get into business with the controversial quarterback."
2022,19,25,Tennessee Titans,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 24 The result of Thursday's Week 17 matchup against the Cowboys counted about as much as a preseason game, so Tennessee used the prime-time contest to rest starters and get a look at Joshua Dobbs at quarterback. Dobbs delivered a more competitive effort than we've seen in limited action from Malik Willis and will make his second straight start in Week 18's winner-take-all matchup against the Jaguars . It's hard to imagine the Titans halting their late-season slide at this point -- this is a roster in need of significant work in the offseason -- but the NFL's decision to schedule the game on Saturday night may give the team an advantage against a Jacksonville team on short rest."
2022,19,26,Los Angeles Rams,5-11,"Previous rank: No. 25 The good vibes of a Christmas Day blowout of the Broncos didn't carry over to a lopsided loss to the playoff-bound Chargers on Sunday at SoFi Stadium, but the Rams have to be encouraged by the strong close from Cam Akers . The running back, whose time with the team seemed all but over in the weeks leading up to the trade deadline, rushed for 123 yards against the Bolts and has back-to-back 100-yard games heading into Sunday's finale against the Seahawks. The Rams -- who have now lost more games than any defending champion in the Super Bowl era -- will take any positives they can find."
2022,19,27,Atlanta Falcons,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 28 The evaluation of Desmond Ridder continues. The rookie quarterback has yet to throw a touchdown pass in three starts, but he did secure his first win as a starter when Younghoe Koo booted a last-second field goal in Sunday's 20-19 conquest over the Cardinals. Ridder was smart with the football and showed some good accuracy on deep balls, even if they didn't end in completions. It remains likely that Atlanta will be active in the quarterback market this offseason, but Ridder can give the team something to think about if he can deliver a strong performance in the season finale against the Bucs ."

Wilson threw a touchdown pass and ran for two scores; he also made a few head-scratching decisions under pressure, an ugly recurring trait during Denver's hugely disappointing season. Credit to interim coach Jerry Rosburg for having the Broncos ready to play after the blowout loss to the Rams and subsequent firing of Nathaniel Hackett . Big changes are coming in Denver."
2022,19,29,Chicago Bears,3-13,"Previous rank: No. 29 There have been reasons for optimism around the Bears in the second half of the season -- mostly due to the rise of Justin Fields -- but Sunday's pummeling at the hands of the rival Lions shows how far this team remains from relevance. Chicago got run out of the building at Ford Field, allowing over 500 yards in a 41-10 loss that keeps the Bears in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. Fields went over 100 yards on the ground once again, but also had one of his worst passing days, completing just seven of 21 attempts for 75 yards while absorbing seven sacks from the league's No. 32-ranked defense. Fields is ruled out for Chicago's season finale against Minnesota due to a hip injury, so it's backup Nathan Peterman getting the start."
2022,19,30,Arizona Cardinals,4-12,"Previous rank: No. 30 A cursed Cardinals season took one more step to its merciful conclusion with a 20-19 loss to the Falcons. Quarterback David Blough stepped into the lineup on short notice and performed admirably after Colt McCoy developed concussion symptoms late in the week. If the journeyman plays well in Sundayâs season finale against the Niners (good luck with that), he could give himself a chance to compete for a backup spot on the roster next summer. That may also depend on Kliff Kingsbury still being the head coach next summer -- a very real question in the present moment."
2022,19,31,Houston Texans,2-13-1,"Previous rank: No. 27 After a commendable run of competitive December games, including a Week 16 win over the Titans , the Texans came down to Earth in a 31-3 loss to the Jaguars. Despite its league-worst record, much is on the line for Houston in Week 18 : With a loss to the Colts, the Texans clinch the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. A win at Indy, coupled with a Bears loss to the Vikings , would move Chicago into the top spot. It also remains to be seen if Lovie Smith is coaching his last game with the team. If Houston brass does decide to move on, it will make it two coaches in two years who were given no real chance to build the program."
2022,19,32,Indianapolis Colts,4-11-1,"Previous rank: No. 31 One more to go. Arguably the most turbulent season in franchise history is nearly over after another lopsided loss , this time at the hands of the Giants at the Meadowlands. Nick Foles â second start of the season was also his last , after he was sacked by Kayvon Thibodeaux and exited the game with an injured rib. On Monday, interim coach Jeff Saturday criticized Thibodeaux's â tasteless â sack celebration as well as the offensive line for not immediately coming to the defense of its quarterback, who was in clear pain while Thibodeaux did his tacky snow-angel routine right next to him. The ugly storylines are on infinite scroll in Indy."
2023,0,1,San Francisco 49ers,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 1 Nick Bosa did it again. A week after bolstering his Defensive Player of the Year candidacy with a game-wrecking performance against the Commanders , Bosa pressured Jarrett Stidham into an overtime interception , ultimately allowing the 49ers to squeeze past the Raiders and extend their winning streak to nine. The defense made the play in crunch time, but it was also an off day for the typically dominant unit, as Vegas rolled up 500 yards of offense. This feels like more of a blip on the radar than cause for alarm, but it would be nice to see the Niners get back to their stingy ways in their final regular-season tune-up against the Cardinals . San Francisco can still claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win and an Eagles loss to the Giants on Sunday."
2023,0,2,Buffalo Bills,12-3,"Previous rank: No. 3 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ Buffalo entered Monday night as a Super Bowl contender at the highest level. How the team proceeds from a competitive standpoint is a complete unknown as we move forward. What we do know is that this is a very tight locker room led by an excellent coach and leader in Sean McDermott. And Thursday morning's update that Damar Ha mlin ""has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours"" and ""appears to be neurologically intact"" lifts the spirits of everyone following this harrowing incident. EDITOR'S UPDATE: Damar Hamlin had his breathing tube removed overnight and ""continues to progress remarkably in his recovery,"" the Bills announced Friday , per the physicians at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Hamlin delivered a message to the team Friday morning and spent time talking to various teammates on FaceTime, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported."
2023,0,3,Cincinnati Bengals,11-4,"Previous rank: No. 4 ï»¿ï»¿ The Bengals deserve much praise for how they've handled everything connected to Damar Hamlin and the awful events of Monday night at Paycor Stadium. The team was immediately supportive of the Bills, and we've seen the same thing from a city pulling for Hamlin and his ongoing recovery. Cincy was on fire with passion to knock off the Bills on Monday night -- by Tuesday night, the skyline was bathed in Buffalo blue in a showing of unity. ""It's bigger than football,"" Zac Taylor said in his first public comments on Wednesday. ""I think Cincinnati and Buffalo are similar in that way and what the communities are about."""
2023,0,4,Kansas City Chiefs,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 5 When the Chiefs said goodbye to Tyreek Hill in a blockbuster trade last spring, it created very real questions about who would step up to replace the explosive Pro Bowler as a touchdown threat in Kansas City. The answer? Jerick McKinnon , obviously. The veteran running back -- re-signed on the eve of training camp -- had two scoring receptions in Sunday's 27-24 win over the Broncos and now has seven TD catches since Week 13, more than any player in football in that span. (Yes, the power of Patrick Mahomes is prominently at play here.)"
2023,0,5,Philadelphia Eagles,13-3,"Previous rank: No. 2 The Eagles missed another chance to clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC , doomed by a slow start and a late Gardner Minshew pick-six in a 20-10 loss to the Saints. Philadelphia's offense was nearly invisible in the first half, managing just 61 total yards and failing to register a first down until 12 seconds remained in the second quarter. The attack perked up after halftime, but it's clear Philly lacks an explosive element without Jalen Hurts at the controls. On the plus side, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Monday that Hurts (shoulder) is expected to be back in the lineup for Sunday's regular-season finale against the Giants , who just locked up the No. 6 seed and could rest starters."
2023,0,6,Dallas Cowboys,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 6 It was a take-care-of-business game for the Cowboys, who easily handled a short-handed Titans team resting multiple players in a Thursday Night Football snoozer. The only real competitive intrigue in the contest came via self-inflicted errors by Dak Prescott , who threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in a sloppy first half. Prescott and the rest of the offense cleaned it up from that point, coasting to the win in the team's third game in 12 days. A victory over the Commanders in Week 18 coupled with an Eagles loss to the Giants would allow the Cowboys to steal the NFC East -- along with, if you throw in a 49ers loss to the Cardinals, the conference's No. 1 seed. It's an unlikely scenario, but it still behooves Dallas to end the regular season playing good football."
2023,0,7,Los Angeles Chargers,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 8 It doesn't feel like Austin Ekeler quite gets his due. Let's try to rectify that a bit right here: Austin Ekeler is a do-it-all superstar, and the Chargers would be lost without him. The sixth-year running back scored two more touchdowns in Sunday's 31-10 win over the Rams (giving him a league-high 18 total scores on the season) and also went over 100 receptions (becoming the only running back to reach the century mark so far this season). He is Los Angeles' jack of all trades on offense and as consistent a performer as you'll find in the sport right now. Fantasy owners shouldn't be the only ones singing this man's praises."
2023,0,8,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 9 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Jaguars kept the train rolling in the most efficient way possible, jumping out to an early lead over the lowly Texans before coasting to a 31-3 win ahead of Saturday night's AFC South-deciding showdown with the Titans . It couldn't have played out better for Doug Pederson, who was able to pull Trevor Lawrence and other key players from the lineup in the second half. A win over the free-falling Titans will give the Jaguars just the second AFC South title in franchise history. If they handle their business on Saturday night, the Jags profile as a potential underdog berserker in the AFC playoffs. One step at a time, of course."
2023,0,9,Green Bay Packers,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 12 ï»¿ï»¿ The Packers are on the doorstep of the playoffs after their fourth consecutive win, and the team's surge is not all about Aaron Rodgers . While the offense has found its footing during this run of success, it's the sudden rise of the previously disappointing defense that has changed the feel of this team. Joe Barry's side of the ball registered four turnovers in a blowout of the Vikings , one week after Green Bay picked off Tua Tagovailoa on three consecutive fourth-quarter possessions to seal a win on Christmas Day. A victory over the Lions on Sunday night punches Green Bay's ticket to the playoffs for the fourth straight year under Matt LaFleur. It would be a remarkable achievement for a team that was once 3-6 and riding a five-game losing streak."
2023,0,10,Detroit Lions,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 11 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Lions dusted themselves off after a humbling loss to the Panthers and took out their frustrations on the poor Bears, who didn't stand a chance in a 41-10 blowout at Ford Field. It was Detroit's eighth game with 30-plus points this season, a franchise record. The explosive Lions rank fourth in scoring thanks in large part to big seasons from Jared Goff , Amon-Ra St. Brown , Jamaal Williams and an elite offensive line, but in order to punch their first postseason ticket since 2016, they still need a win on Sunday against the surging Packers and a Seahawks home loss to the Rams . With apologies to the 12s, I think it's safe to say the general public is pulling for the underdog Lions to make the tourney."
2023,0,11,Minnesota Vikings,12-4,"Previous rank: No. 7 ï»¿ï»¿ The Vikings are like The Alliance of Magicians headed by G.O.B. in Arrested Development , posing for a goofy group photo while holding a sign that reads ""We Demand To Be Taken Seriously."" Twelve wins and a division title cannot be ignored, but it's hard to credibly view the Vikes as Super Bowl contenders when their season is littered with gnarly blowout losses like the 41-17 takedown we witnessed on Sunday at Lambeau Field. Minnesota suffered meltdowns in every phase of the game and generally looked like the clearly inferior team despite the records of the parties involved. The doubts will follow this team into the postseason."
2023,0,12,Baltimore Ravens,10-6,"Previous rank: No. 10 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Ravens showed once again on Sunday night they do not close out teams at a championship level. This time it was the rival Steelers, who marched to the go-ahead touchdown in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter in a painful 16-13 loss for the home team at M&T Bank Stadium. The defeat underscores growing questions about how seriously this squad can be taken as a contender in the AFC. Late-game issues notwithstanding, the defense remains solid, but this offense is not good enough with Ty Huntley behind center. The uncertain status of Lamar Jackson (knee) hangs over this team like a dark storm cloud. EDITOR'S UPDATE: On Friday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh ruled Lamar Jackson out of Sunday's game against the Bengals."
2023,0,13,New York Giants,9-6-1,"Previous rank: No. 14 ï»¿ï»¿ The Giants are back in the playoffs for the first time since 2016 -- disregard Danny Dimes and Co. at your own peril. Daniel Jones played his best game of the season in a blowout of the Colts , accounting for four total scores before exiting the game in the fourth quarter to chants of his name from the celebrating faithful at MetLife Stadium. ""Hearing his name get chanted, it's a beautiful thing,"" Saquon Barkley said, per NorthJersey.com . ""You can finally see he's starting to get the respect that he earns."" Barkley has been the driver of the Giants' offense for most of the season, but Jones' growth under Coach of the Year candidate Brian Daboll has been a huge development for the franchise. Big Blue is in good hands."
2023,0,14,Pittsburgh Steelers,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 17 ""Kenny F------ Pickett."" Apparently, those were the three words uttered by Mike Tomlin to Kenny Pickett seconds after the rookie quarterback led the Steelers on the second late go-ahead touchdown drive in as many weeks in a dramatic prime-time win over the rival Ravens . Pickett has made strides over the course of his first season and shows poise not usually seen from a young QB. It makes him a snug fit for a Pittsburgh team that -- with its T.J. Watt -led defense and improving running game -- needs a quarterback who can run the offense in a smart and efficient manner. It's extremely promising to see Pickett already at this place in his development. And stunningly, given the 2-6 start to the season, the Steelers can still make the playoffs with a home win over the Browns and some outside help."
2023,0,15,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 20 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ At long last, Tom Brady and Mike Evans are back in business. After months of misfires and near misses, the two stars were locked in when it mattered most, connecting on three long touchdowns in a 30-24 win over the Panthers that clinched a second straight NFC South title for Tampa Bay. Evans couldn't be covered by the Carolina secondary, finishing with 207 yards on the day and going over the 1,000-yard receiving mark for the ninth consecutive season. Brady and his alpha wideout are back in sync, making the Bucs a more compelling playoff entrant. ""We've battled through a lot of tough things this year,"" Brady said . ""Happy to win the division. It's always tough to do it. NFL games are tough to win, and we always figure out a way to keep them somehow exciting. I wish they wouldn't be as exciting as we made them."""
2023,0,16,Seattle Seahawks,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 22 ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ The Seahawks are still in the playoff hunt after a well-rounded 23-6 win over the Jets at Lumen Field. Geno Smith and Pete Carroll gained a measure of revenge in eliminating their former team from postseason contention, while the defense delivered its second consecutive strong performance after an extended slump that put Seattle's season on the brink. The 'Hawks will qualify for the dance with a win over the Rams and a Packers loss to the Lions, but they'll have to do battle without leading tackler Jordyn Brooks , who suffered a torn ACL on Sunday."
2023,0,17,New England Patriots,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 18 Nobody really needs to see this particular Patriots team in the playoffs, but they might just get there to spite us. Led once again by a wildly opportunistic defense, the Pats remain in the playoff race after a 23-21 win over the Dolphins in Foxborough. Breakout safety Kyle Dugger had the biggest play of the game, a third-quarter pick-six that put New England ahead for good against its struggling AFC East rival. It was Dugger's third touchdown of the season and the Pats' seventh defensive score of the year. It's not unfair to surmise that this would be an 11- or 12-loss Patriots team if not for the impeccably timed heroics of the non- Mac Jones side of the ball."
2023,0,18,Carolina Panthers,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 19 The Panthers had it all in front of them. Carolina was up 14-0 in the first quarter and 21-10 early in the fourth, but turnovers, combined with repeated coverage breakdowns around Mike Evans (three touchdowns, 207 yards receiving), were too much to overcome in a 30-24 loss to the Bucs. Tampa Bay wins another NFC South title , and Carolina is left to ponder how this game might have been different if star cornerback Jaycee Horn hadn't been sidelined by wrist surgery . The Panthers will finish out the season with a matchup against the Saints -- it's a game that means very little in the standings but could have a big impact on ownership's ultimate decision on interim coach Steve Wilks."
2023,0,19,Las Vegas Raiders,6-10,"Previous rank: No. 21 In the end, the Raiders delivered a season that was Vegas to the core: They ultimately lost, but everyone was entertained. Jarrett Stidham replaced Derek Carr in the starting lineup and delivered an extremely promising debut in an overtime defeat to the mighty 49ers, throwing for 365 yards and three touchdowns against the NFL's best defense. Stidham looked completely at home in Josh McDaniels' offense, and you can imagine the Raiders will think long and hard about giving the 26-year-old a shot at the starting job in 2023 if he can deliver a similar performance in Saturday's finale against the Chiefs . This feels like a very real late-season ""audition"" for the QB."
2023,0,20,Miami Dolphins,8-8,"Previous rank: No. 13 The Dolphins' 2022 season by result: W, W, W, L, L, L, W, W, W, W, W, L, L, L, L, L. The absurd symmetry is hard to look at for Miami fans, who got sucked in by this team twice before a five-game losing skid. The Fins can salvage their season and punch their playoff ticket with a home win over the similarly free-falling Jets on Sunday and a Patriots loss in Buffalo , but quarterback chaos continues to follow the team. Tua Tagovailoa (in the concussion protocol) is unlikely to be an option , and the availability of Teddy Bridgewater is in doubt after he suffered a finger injury Sunday. It is fair to wonder if seventh-round rookie Skylar Thompson is ready for this. EDITOR'S UPDATE: On Friday, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Skylar Thompson will start against the Jets."
2023,0,21,New York Jets,7-9,"Previous rank: No. 15 ""We feel like we blew the season."" Garrett Wilson spoke regretfully about Sunday's 23-6 loss to the Seahawks, which eliminated the Jets from postseason contention , but the rookie wide receiver's lament is applicable across a five-week stretch of misery for Gang Green, whose league-worst playoff drought has now extended to 12 years.

Nick Foles â second start of the season was also his last , after he was sacked by Kayvon Thibodeaux and exited the game with an injured rib. On Monday, interim coach Jeff Saturday criticized Thibodeaux's â tasteless â sack celebration as well as the offensive line for not immediately coming to the defense of its quarterback, who was in clear pain while Thibodeaux did his tacky snow-angel routine right next to him. The ugly storylines are on infinite scroll in Indy."
2023,1,1,Kansas City Chiefs,,"Itâs always a bit surprising when the rival Chiefs and Raiders make a trade. But the real reveal here is acquiring DT Neil Farrell from Las Vegas might be an indication the Chiefs really are prepared to start the season without Chris Jones , who still has not reported to the team as of this writing. Jones has already hinted at sitting out until Week 8 amid his contract dispute with the club, and Travis Kelce was pleading for his return last week. Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes seem to be taking a more zen-like approach to his absence for now. The Chiefsâ Super Bowl title defense will be challenging enough with Jones, but itâs an even steeper climb without him. Theyâve been without him for two- and three-game stretches in recent seasons, but never anywhere close to half a season."
2023,1,2,Philadelphia Eagles,,"The Eagles arguably have the deepest roster in the NFL, with few obvious concerns across the board. How loaded are they? Derek Barnett is perhaps their fifth-best pass rusher now. But if thereâs a position higher on the importance ladder that looks a bit thin right now, itâs wide receiver. A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith are All-Pro caliber. But they currently have only Quez Watkins and Olamide Zaccheaus behind them on the roster. Thus, losing either Brown or Smith for an extended period would fundamentally change the makeup of this unit. Right now, itâs not a worry. Itâs the kind of thing normally not taken into massive consideration until itâs a problem. The Eagles have to hope it never becomes one."
2023,1,3,Buffalo Bills,,"Von Miller is out for at least the first four weeks of the season, setting up a fascinating battle in Week 1 . Sure, Josh Allen and Aaron Rodgers get top billing in this AFC East clash, but dig deeper and you see a shorthanded Bills pass rush against a Jets offensive line that has only recently come together as planned. But Buffalo trading Boogie Basham before the roster-cut deadline is an indication the Bills think they have enough with Greg Rousseau , Leonard Floyd , Shaq Lawson , A.J. Epenesa and Kingsley Jonathan to stem the tide until Miller returns. A strong showing against a still-jelling Jets group on Monday night would go a long way toward quelling any early fears about the teeth of the pass-rush unit."
2023,1,4,San Francisco 49ers,,"In the preseason Power Rankings , I had the 49ers third -- way higher than the social-media cognoscenti felt was warranted. They have no quarterback , some said, which was incorrect ... but it brings up an interesting debate: Is Brock Purdy guaranteed to be the answer? His rookie effort was eye-openingly good, but thatâs an awfully small sample size of eight starts -- and Purdy is coming off a serious elbow injury. Thankfully, the Niners are pretty stacked at most positions, and as last season proved, they can win big with multiple quarterbacks starting. Purdy's surpassed all expectations and has returned from injury , which likely made it easier for the team to trade Trey Lance . But thereâs no doubt that questions remain about whether the former Mr. Irrelevant is the teamâs QB of the future heading into the 2023 season."
2023,1,5,Cincinnati Bengals,,"This summer, coach Zac Taylor called the Bengalsâ roster the deepest heâs had since he was hired in 2019. One major question heading into the regular season: Is it the final year for Tee Higgins in Cincinnati? Presumably, Joe Burrow âs extension will get done soon enough, but Higginsâ future seems less certain . At the very least, the Bengals hedged this year in drafting WRs Charlie Jones and Andrei Iosivas -- and keeping them on the 53-man roster over special-teams ace Stanley Morgan . They took a similar approach in 2022, drafting DBs Dax Hill and Cam Taylor-Britt in Rounds 1 and 2 prior to walk years for safeties Jessie Bates and Vonn Bell ."
2023,1,6,Dallas Cowboys,,"The big news was the unexpected trade for Trey Lance -- and what it ultimately means for Dak Prescott . Whatever ends up happening, the move feels like a worthy one, with Lance now able to develop behind the scenes. The opportunity to become Prescottâs backup in 2024 could be there. Perhaps Prescottâs future negotiations will help put Lance in a spot where he could one day become the Cowboysâ starter. But there seems to be a healthy dose of optimism with Prescott and the â Texas Coast â offense this season, to the point where I am buying in."
2023,1,7,Baltimore Ravens,,"Cornerback has been the position earning the most preseason hand-wringing, considering the injuries the Ravens have incurred there. But what about the pass rush? Tyus Bowser will miss at least the first four weeks on the non-football injury list. That likely means Odafe Oweh , David Ojabo and Jadeveon Clowney will be the top three rushers for the first month of the season, and Ojabo has missed some practice time with injury. Oweh is likely to be a better player than we saw a year ago, but this setup puts him squarely in the spotlight in a pivotal Year 3. The pass rush can help mitigate any issues in the secondary, but thatâs only if this group shows early on it can significantly impact games."
2023,1,8,Miami Dolphins,,"There have been some preseason disappointments, such as losing CB Jalen Ramsey to injury , not signing RB Dalvin Cook , not signing DT Christian Wilkins to a long-term deal and keeping only two of their four 2023 draft picks. But the hope of the 2023 Dolphins was always built on a healthier Tua Tagovailoa and the work Vic Fangio can do with a talented defense. And though the schedule looks tough on paper, they do have nine home games, with seven true road contests and a contest in Germany against the Chiefs. Health will be a season-long story to monitor, but all things being equal, this team might be ready to make an incremental improvement over coach Mike McDanielâs promising first year."
2023,1,9,Jacksonville Jaguars,,"The Jaguars have the luxury of facing a rookie QB (the Coltsâ Anthony Richardson ) in Week 1, followed by three straight home games. The significance here is that is how long LT Cam Robinson âs four-game suspension will keep him out. The Jaguars will have to pray for good health at the position, because theyâll absolutely be thin without the veteran. Walker Little and rookie Anton Harrison are in line to start at tackle, but the Jags lost a key depth piece with Josh Wells on IR. The offense could be scary with the additions of WR Calvin Ridley and RB Tank Bigsby , along with Trevor Lawrence and other young standouts improving. But thatâs also contingent on the tackles holding up early in the season."
2023,1,10,New York Jets,,"The most important thing for Aaron Rodgers was to make it out of the preseason healthy, and the Jetsâ offensive line appears to be trending in the right direction after some nervous moments in camp. The preseason felt like a success. Considering this team went 7-10 last year with three starting QBs all completing less than 59 percent of their passes, itâs hard not to see the path to improvement. But the NFL doesnât always work that way, and the Jets have a whale of a schedule , facing the Bills, Cowboys, Chiefs and Eagles prior to the Week 7 bye. Buckle up, Jets fans. Itâll be a wild ride one way or another."
2023,1,11,Detroit Lions,,"Even if the Lions arenât quite as dynamic offensively as they were in 2022, itâs hard to imagine their defense isnât vastly improved. Perhaps Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs pick away at them on Thursday night or, say, the Falcons (whom they play in Week 3 ) grind their way to success against Detroit. But top to bottom, this defense has added talent and depth during the offseason -- which speaks to the Lions keeping 29 defenders on the initial roster. And just look where theyâre coming from: Last year was a struggle , even accounting for some late-season improvement. More sacks and takeaways helped mask things in 2022, but now they have more impact players in the front seven and better coverage options in the back end. Can coordinator Aaron Glenn make it work with an aggressive, man-heavy scheme? I think so, even with some expected hiccups."
2023,1,12,Los Angeles Chargers,,"Is Justin Herbert ready to make an MVP run? Iâm not ruling it out. The Chargersâ offensive line is as strong as it has been since his arrival. Assuming good health, I would say the same thing about the wide receivers. Austin Ekeler is back, still likely motivated by his contract desires . Throw in some weapons at tight end, and everything is there for Herbert to have a monster season -- even with a wicked schedule . Last season, Herbert played through a painful rib injury and a torn labrum in his left (non-throwing) shoulder. That shortened some of his pass attempts and minimized the threat of him scrambling. With Herbert and the offensive line healthy, new coordinator Kellen Moore can marry his north-south run game and vertical passing game to make this one of the NFLâs most dangerous units."
2023,1,13,Seattle Seahawks,,"The Seahawks made it to the postseason a year ago despite going 4-6 in one-score games. So, if we assume Geno Smith performs much like he did in 2022, Seattle really has a chance to improve off what it accomplished last season. The leaky run defense was an area of concentration this offseason, and GM John Schneider added playmakers in rookies Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Zach Charbonnet . With the Cardinals and Rams possibly in rebuild mode, the Seahawksâ focus now must be on finding a way to beat the 49ers, who had their number in all three meetings last season. But they have time to figure that out, as they wonât face San Francisco until Weeks 12 and 14 ."
2023,1,14,Pittsburgh Steelers,,"Iâm starting to wonder if this is too low . The Steelers were hot down the stretch last season, winning seven of their last nine games (including four straight at the end), and all they did this preseason was blowtorch their three opponents. The latter must be weighed carefully, but it was hard not to see how fluid and explosive the first-team offense looked (five TDs in five drives). The AFC North should be one of the best divisions, and the 49ers will be a stiff Week 1 test , but the schedule really does lay out nicely for Pittsburgh. All of this depends on Kenny Pickett making a Year 2 jump. Also, the defense needs to give up fewer big plays, but most arrows appear to point upward."
2023,1,15,Minnesota Vikings,,"The Vikings won 13 games last season despite being outscored (-3 point differential). Going 11-0 in one-score games explains a lot of that, but it also raises the question of whether the Vikings -- who parted with some key contributors this offseason and are quite young on defense -- can repeat that effort in 2023. They should remain a fairly potent offense this season, but what new defensive coordinator Brian Flores can achieve with a heavily revamped unit could end up determining this teamâs ceiling. Harrison Smith should make more plays up in the box, and there are some interesting front-seven defenders, but the cornerback position concerns me. Itâs not hard to imagine a drop in wins, even if the defense improves."
2023,1,16,New Orleans Saints,,"The year is 2023, and weâre still talking about Michael Thomas and Jimmy Graham in New Orleans. How wild is that? Graham is back with the Saints for the first time since 2014, and itâs a story few could have imagined after Graham didnât play in the league last season. But of the two, I believe itâs Thomas who has the best chance to rewrite his career script -- and also make the Saints contenders this season. His injury issues have been nearly unending since 2020, but Thomas just might be ready for another big season after three years of pain. If Derek Carr has enough weapons and time to throw, the Saints could reclaim the NFC South in what feels like a transition period in the division."
2023,1,17,Atlanta Falcons,,"Awaiting Desmond Ridder is a chance to prove he is indeed Atlantaâs quarterback of the future . I think the Falcons are providing Ridder a pretty darned good surrounding cast -- a strong O-line, a potentially elite pair of running backs, Drake London , Kyle Pitts and, if healthy , Cordarelle Patterson . I also like Mack Hollins as a sneaky big-play option. With the blocking and run game, Ridder should be in favorable second- and third-down situations. If the defense becomes more of a takeaway unit (had just 17 last season) or generates a better pass rush (a 3.6% sack rate wonât cut it again) -- and I anticipate improvement in both areas -- itâll give Ridder better field position, too. Donât snooze on the Falcons, folks."
2023,1,18,Cleveland Browns,,"The Browns initially were my summer crush, the team I thought had the best chance to be this yearâs 2022 Vikings. But as the days wore on, with kicking issues and injuries darkening my thoughts, my eyes started to wander. Deshaun Watson almost certainly will be better than the version we saw on the field last season. But by how much? The division has a razor-thin margin, and the Browns lost six one-score games a year ago. They canât afford further kicking woes and disappointing QB play."
2023,1,19,New York Giants,,"Brian Daboll built up a lot of goodwill with his surprising first-year success, which included the Giantsâ first postseason win in 11 years. How high can this team fly? The Darren Waller acquisition and more speed at receiver give the offense a higher ceiling. This is a more talented team than last yearâs version. But the defense must do a better job against the run and force more turnovers to net improvement in the standings. The front-seven reinforcements should help the run defense, but the takeaway question lingers. Big Blue's 13 fumble recoveries a year ago were the NFLâs second-most, but the six INTs were tied for last. Can a reshuffled secondary (that likely will feature two rookies playing big roles) change that?"
2023,1,20,Denver Broncos,,"We can slice and dice the roster any way we want, but letâs be honest: This season boils down to what Sean Payton and Russell Wilson do. Payton was out of the game for a year, but his offenses ranked in the top 10 in points and yards 11 times during his run in New Orleans. Wilson was on a sure-fire Hall of Fame track, a singular playmaker for a decade in Seattle before the bottom dropped out in 2022. Will this pairing work? How Wilson fares this season will go a long way toward determining his future in Denver. But itâs not just Payton helping him out. I highly recommend the recent feature by colleague James Palmer, which lays out just how important a role new quarterbacks coach Davis Webb -- only months removed from his playing career -- might play in a potential Wilson rebound ."
2023,1,21,Green Bay Packers,,"The Packers' reported interest in Jonathan Taylor is interesting -- and I am not sure it has abated. The Colts resisted trading Taylor before cutdowns, but it doesn't feel like anything is settled in Indianapolis. The Packers' full youth movement is wild and exciting to watch unfold; on offense, David Bakhtiari (31) and Aaron Jones (28) are the only expected starters over the age of 27. Adding the 24-year-old Taylor only would make them younger. Could this play out as a transition season for Jordan Love and the Packers, similar to Aaron Rodgers ' first year starting in 2008? After that 6-10 campaign, Green Bay enjoyed a decade-plus of steady contention."
2023,1,22,Tennessee Titans,,"Especially on offense, the Titans feel like they're entering a flashpoint season, capable of going one of two ways. Either veterans Ryan Tannehill , Derrick Henry and DeAndre Hopkins flourish and put the Titans back in real contention, or they flame out collectively, pushing this franchise into the rebuild some ( not Jeffery Simmons !) thought might occur this offseason. But there are two younger players entering critical seasons who can go a long way toward helping the veteran core: WR Treylon Burks and LT Andre Dillard . After a tough rookie season , Burks dealt with an LCL sprain in August. Can his ability shine through? Is Dillard truly a first-round talent who never got a proper shake in Philly? If those two players flourish, the Titans could really have an offensive foundation in place. If they struggle, all bets are off."
2023,1,23,Washington Commanders,,"Defensively, this team should be very tough. The pass rush could be lethal if Chase Young ever gets healthy and figures it out. The secondary looks versatile and talented. Linebacker doesn't excite me, but it's hard to gripe too much. If Sam Howell can somehow have a 2022 Geno Smith type of season, why can't the Commanders make the playoffs? It would be a fitting development amid an ownership change, one that has rendered more excitement than the franchise has enjoyed in years. There's pressure on Ron Rivera to win now, one might imagine. But it's also surely there for offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, who must know how much a successful season could mean for his career."
2023,1,24,New England Patriots,,"Itâs hard to know what to expect from a team that looks like it could be fourth-best in the AFC East (arguably a top-two division in the league) in terms of talent. Sure, the Patriots can and will run the ball effectively, and the defense should be a good-to-very-good unit even without Devin McCourty , whose departure will be felt throughout the organization. But whereâs the offensive firepower? Rhamondre Stevenson can do a lot, and Ezekiel Elliott should help prevent the third-year back from wearing down, but the pass-catching group looks like a solid collection of second, third and fourth options. Thereâs no one player who changes the way teams will defend New England. Even with Bill OâBrien back in the fold, the Patriotsâ lack of an elite playmaker is far and away my biggest worry about this team entering the season."
2023,1,25,Carolina Panthers,,"There's bubbling support for the Panthers as potential NFC South champs, and ... sure, why not? Heck, they made a valiant run at it last season after firing their coach, shipping their star running back away in a trade and rolling with Sam Darnold and PJ Walker under center instead of the Week 1 QB, who was released in December . With No. 1 pick Bryce Young , a defense offering upside and new coach Frank Reich in place, one might argue their chances can't be dismissed. That's fair. But on cutdown day, Carolina jettisoned many players from the Matt Rhule regime, opting for youth at multiple spots. The excitement over Young is tangible, but this season's goals are more about Young's development, I suspect, than the Panthers' final win percentage."
2023,1,26,Chicago Bears,,"Justin Fields ' preseason work was fine, albeit brief. But with Fields due for a possible extension next offseason, everyone knows how important this season is to determining his future with the Bears, who are waiting for him to turn the proverbial corner. GM Ryan Poles recently said he needs to see more steps in his QB's development. ""Want those sack numbers to come down, interceptions to come down, make good reads, protect himself, just see him take that next step,"" Poles said . The dream, of course, would be for Fields to make a Jalen Hurts -esque leap from Year 2 to 3. Their second-year numbers actually compare quite favorably, although Fields' sack rate (14.7% last season to Hurts' 5.7% in 2021) and interception rate (3.5% last season to Hurts' 2.1% in 2021) truly are concerning outliers until proven otherwise."
2023,1,27,Las Vegas Raiders,,"Some observers might be focused on what a Jimmy Garoppolo -led Raiders offense might look like with Davante Adams , Jakobi Meyers , Michael Mayer and (now that he's returned following a contract standoff) Josh Jacobs . But if Las Vegas is truly serious about changing its trajectory, the defense must hold up its end of the bargain. Very little carries over year to year in the NFL, but the Raiders have been bottom dwellers in two major statistical categories over the past several years: turnovers and sacks. The Raiders forced a paltry 13 turnovers last season and -- get this! -- haven't topped 17 in a season since 2016, when Garoppolo and Josh McDaniels were winning a Super Bowl in New England together."
2023,1,28,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,,"What an interesting roster here, with some truly elite top-end talent ( Tristan Wirfs , Lavonte David , Mike Evans , Chris Godwin , Antoine Winfield Jr. ) but also six undrafted free agents making the opening 53 . Evans' recent contract drama puts his Bucs future in doubt, and it's worth remembering starting QB Baker Mayfield is on a one-year deal. It's not a complete youth movement, but it's headed that way. If Mayfield wants more time in Tampa, his mission is clear: avoid turnovers. He's had the most interceptions (64) in the NFL since 2018, and the Bucs' defense took a step backward in takeaways last season, giving the team a turnover differential of -2 -- one reason the Tom Brady-led iteration of this squad had to scratch its way to an 8-9 mark. Operating in the red on turnovers again won't lead to more wins."
2023,1,29,Indianapolis Colts,,"There has been a near-constant stream of disappointment for the Colts since dropping that fateful Week 18 game in January of 2022, and there's only so much light on the horizon, with Jonathan Taylor opening the season on the PUP list -- and with his contract demands remaining unresolved. It's not the way Indianapolis wanted to start the Anthony Richardson era, but these are the cards they've been dealt (and dealt to themselves). Richardson offers the best hope for a surprise season if he can have a Cam Newton-like Year 1. Newton helped the 2011 Panthers improve by four wins, limping to a slow start, then putting up an encouraging finish. That's a reasonable outlook, I think, for your 2023 Colts. Will Taylor be part of that? No one knows."
2023,1,30,Los Angeles Rams,,"Aaron Donald considered retirement following the Rams' Super Bowl LVI victory. After a trying 2022 season, he's back as the unquestionable leader of the Rams' defense as they try to climb back to respectability. It's a very young roster, which could result in early-season growing pains. Could Donald be moved to a contender if the Rams slip out of the race prior to 4 p.m. ET on All Hallows' Eve, a.k.a. the trade deadline? I wouldn't rule out a scenario similar to Von Miller exiting Denver to chase a Super Bowl with the Rams in 2021. Los Angeles is awash in dead cap money and would surely love to stockpile future assets. Trading Donald was once unthinkable, but now it feels like it will be a quite-reasonable possibility at some point."
2023,1,31,Houston Texans,,"What would represent a successful season for rookie QB C.J. Stroud ? Expectations will always be high for the second overall pick in any draft, but perspective is important. Twenty-two rookie QBs have started 12-plus games over the previous decade, and their collective averages are pretty middling: 3,161 passing yards, 60.7 percent completion rate, 17 TDs and 13 INTs in roughly 14 starts. Those numbers feel reasonable for Stroud. The run game will help, some of the young targets have promise and offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik is viewed as an up-and-comer. But the offensive line hasnât lived up to expectations, and Stroud threw cautiously in the preseason (4.5 yards/attempt). Heâll have Dalton Schultz and Robert Woods as security blankets, but this offense has limited firepower."
2023,1,32,Arizona Cardinals,,"Even the most optimistic onlooker has to expect a turbulent season and protracted rebuild for Arizona. Those things tend to happen to teams with a first-year head coach -- and those whose starting quarterback is out indefinitely to begin the season. But Iâll offer up the caveat that sometimes the preseason bottom dwellers end up being ... not terrible. Two years ago, the Bengals were widely expected to struggle and they ended up winning the AFC North. And about this time last year, the Falcons were commonly ranked among the lowest teams in the league only to finish with a 7-10 record. That's something, right?"
2023,2,1,San Francisco 49ers,1-0,"The 49ers dominated the first half against the Steelers and delivered the knockout blow to Pittsburgh two plays into the third quarter. Christian McCaffrey âs 65-yard run started with perfect execution up front. McCaffrey spun past the Steelersâ Levi Wallace and was aided by blocks from WRs Brandon Aiyuk and Ray-Ray McCloud III . It was just a devastating play from a 49ers offense that was in full command on the road in Week 1. I suspected San Francisco's defense would pick up where it left off, and it did just that. But the offensive explosion was the Week 1 headline, answering any questions anyone might have about the ability or health of QB Brock Purdy . Truly brilliant stuff."
2023,2,2,Kansas City Chiefs,0-1,"Now that weâve all had time to breathe -- and watch the other Week 1 games -- the Chiefsâ loss to the Lions doesnât feel quite as cataclysmic. Travis Kelce is making progress in his recovery from a knee injury, while Chris Jones will be back now that he and the team have agreed to a new one-year deal . Furthermore, the Raiders being the only AFC West team to win was another nice development for K.C. All that said, thereâs no getting over the fact that Kadarius Toney and Skyy Moore had a bad, no-good season opener. They combined for one catch (and three drops) on eight targets and 3 yards on two rushes. These are two players the Chiefs were -- and, I think, still are -- counting on pretty heavily this season. Can one of them step up? I think so, but Toneyâs performance in Week 1 scares me."
2023,2,3,Philadelphia Eagles,1-0,"One drive and two Patriots turnovers helped the Eagles build a 16-0 lead a little over 12 minutes into Sundayâs game , yet it was an absolute slog offensively from that point on. Philadelphia totaled 151 net yards and nine first downs over their next 10 possessions and ended up converting just four of their 13 third-down attempts. Despite benefitting from a few Patriots penalties, the Eaglesâ offense at no point resembled the group we saw become an elite unit in 2022. Perhaps the rust was expected based on the opponent, location and lack of preseason reps for the first-team offense. A quick turnaround for Thursdayâs game against the Vikings should reveal if these are chronic issues."
2023,2,4,Dallas Cowboys,1-0,"The Cowboys had a pedestrian night offensively -- two of their five touchdowns came via the defense/special teams -- and utterly dominated the Giants in MetLife Stadium. Even we true believers could not have imagined a defensive performance like that , rainy conditions or not. It took Dan Quinnâs unit about five plays to settle in and then completely dismantle the Giantsâ offense in a performance that wonât quiet the Super Bowl talk in Dallas. The one interesting offensive wrinkle for the 'Boys: a package of plays for KaVontae Turpin . After logging a grand total of four offensive touches in 2022, he had five on Sunday night. And they were pretty effective, too! Who said Mike McCarthy isnât a clever play-caller?"
2023,2,5,Miami Dolphins,1-0,"The Dolphinsâ performance against the Chargers should absolutely frighten the heck out of the rest of the league. The Fins fell flat offensively when they visited the Bolts last December , but they delivered a pretty big message on Sunday, racking up 536 yards in the shootout win. Miami didnât go two straight possessions without scoring and crossed Los Angeles' 30-yard line on every possession but one. I love how Mike McDanielâs schemes build room for his speedsters to get close to max mph as they get the ball. Most teams canât deal with the Dolphinsâ speed, I suspect. Sure, the defense must tighten up, especially against the run. But this has to be demoralizing game tape for Miami's opponents to watch."
2023,2,6,Detroit Lions,1-0,"Dan Campbell probably couldnât have scripted his teamâs road triumph over the Chiefs any better than it turned out. The Lions sent a big message to the rest of the league. Campbellâs â I didnât learn anything â comment after the game might feel like a trope, but this team had me believing. Did the offense sputter a bit more than I expected against a Chris Jones -less Chiefs defense? It did. Am I worried? Not particularly, especially if Jahmyr Gibbs â role is expanded a bit more. And how about that rookie class? With Gibbs and Sam LaPorta on offense and Jack Campbell and Brian Branch on defense, those first four picks look terrific so far. This roster oozes young, exciting talent."
2023,2,7,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-0,"Early mistakes put the Jaguars in a hole against the Colts , but it says something that the team could coolly move ahead late with some offensive flourishes and win comfortably enough on the road. Calvin Ridley is the real deal, as he and Trevor Lawrence looked like a perfect match in their first regular-season outing together. The early returns for Tank Bigsby were less encouraging. His go-ahead TD in the fourth quarter put the Jags ahead for good, but the rookie dropped a pass that became a pick in the second quarter and he lacked awareness on a bizarre play that led to a Colts defensive TD. Doug Pederson has trusted the third-round pick to this point, but Bigsby needs to tighten things up."
2023,2,8,Buffalo Bills,0-1,"Buffaloâs 11-play, 75-yard drive in the second quarter on Monday night -- capped by a fabulous Josh Allen-to-Stefon Diggs touchdown against a very good Jets defense -- felt like a massive statement. The message? âWeâre back.â Then the Bills were held out of the end zone for the next 35 minutes of football. After the touchdown, Allen threw two picks (giving him three total on the night) and lost a fumble. Just too many careless passes and poor overall ball security. Allen made big throws late, and his offensive line gave up a number of pressures, but he just seemed to make his job a lot harder than it needed to be. The Bills have a Super Bowl-caliber squad, but itâs predicated on the offense being much better than what we saw in the season-opening loss to the Aaron Rodgers-less Jets at MetLife."
2023,2,9,New York Jets,1-0,"No teamâs offseason narrative was rewritten more in Week 1 than the Jets', who immediately encountered overwhelming adversity in the form of Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury . But given the way New York gutted out the overtime victory over Buffalo, itâs impossible not to respect this team. Such a bittersweet night for the Jets, who watched Breece Hall return from last season's ACL injury in style â¦ Garrett Wilson author an early Catch of the Year candidate â¦ Zach Wilson produce his biggest victory as a Jet â¦ Jordan Whitehead pick off three Josh Allen passes ... and Hard Knocks star Xavier Gipson deliver a legendary walk-off score . Rodgersâ injury cuts extremely deep. But New York's defense looks borderline elite, and the Hall- Dalvin Cook duo can handle the heavy lifting. Robert Salehâs team has plenty of grit and talent. Iâm still in."
2023,2,10,Baltimore Ravens,1-0,"Even without Mark Andrews in Week 1, expectations for the new offense were higher than what the Ravens produced against the Texans . It wasnât bad, mind you, but it's clear Baltimore is still adjusting to new offensive coordinator Todd Monkenâs system. What was bad: losing three offensive players to injury in the game. We already know RB J.K. Dobbins is done for the year with an Achilles tear , while OLs Ronnie Stanley (knee) and Tyler Linderbaum (ankle) are considered week to week, per head coach John Harbaugh. Even if the latter two are ultimately not long-term worries, the setbacks compounded an underwhelming opening offensive performance. The pieces are there for Baltimore to be dangerous on that side of the ball, as first-round pick Zay Flowers had a strong debut and Lamar Jackson flashed occasional magic. But the room for improvement is obvious."
2023,2,11,Cincinnati Bengals,0-1,"What to do with the Bengals? On the one hand, itâs easy to write off Week 1âs disaster performance based on history. The Browns delivered a similarly humbling loss to Cincinnati last Halloween and have had the Bengalsâ number defensively in recent meetings. Cincy also stunk in Week 1 last year, dropping a five-turnover clunker to Pittsburgh . Plus, Joe Burrow missed nearly all of training camp, which clearly hurt his and the offenseâs timing. The Browns certainly deserve defensive credit. But itâs just hard to imagine Burrowâs struggles lingering or the Bengals enduring another game where Tee Higgins has eight targets and zero catches. Yet, like a year ago, the offensive line fell flat in the opener. Thatâs the one issue that worries me long term."
2023,2,12,Los Angeles Chargers,0-1,"On a day when the offense was terrific, the defense turned in a mostly abysmal performance -- the kind that makes me question the Chargers. The Bolts' D, which is littered with talent, has continuity with nine returning starters. But the unit was picked apart by the Dolphins , one chunk play at a time, to the tune of 466 passing yards, the most ever allowed by any team with Brandon Staley as its head coach or coordinator, per NFL Research. Yes, Staleyâs defense looks worse than it did a year ago, even if one game is admittedly too small a sample size for grand pronouncements. The Chargers must find a way to avoid squandering Justin Herbert âs prime, and right now that starts on D."
2023,2,13,Cleveland Browns,1-0,"I won't harp on this yet, because the Browns' revamped defense absolutely turned in a banner performance in working over the Bengals in Week 1 , and that's a sign of progress. But it's a good thing Joe Burrow struggled more than Deshaun Watson did, because the Browns have some issues offensively, compounded by the season-ending injury on Sunday to RT Jack Conklin .The weather conditions in Cleveland were not ideal for pristine execution on Sunday, and it was encouraging to see the Browns try to stretch the field vertically and use Watson's legs as a real weapon, with the latter strategy at least being effective. But if Watson struggles again throwing the ball vs. an angry Steelers team in Week 2 , I am prepared to dive in deeper there."
2023,2,14,New Orleans Saints,1-0,"Derek Carr got his first win as a Saint, and the defense carried an outsized load in the victory over the Titans . But letâs talk special teams, because those units helped tip the game in New Orleansâ favor. Rookie kicker Blake Grupe won a camp battle and showed why against Tennessee, making all three field goals (including a game-tying 52-yarder) and his only extra point. He also blasted five touchbacks. Punter Lou Hedley is just as inexperienced, but he averaged 48.2 yards on five punts. Zack Baun âs blocked punt -- with Steve Gleason in the house! -- shows why he made the team despite having a minimal role on defense. The Saints have some things to clean up, but there were subtle shades of 2006 magic on Sunday."
2023,2,15,Green Bay Packers,1-0,"When you drill down on Jordan Love 's performance in the 38-20 win at Chicago, certain things need refinement. The Packers didn't mount a true drive until the second half, having been gifted twice with short fields early. But once Love settled in, he was pretty terrific , all things considered. He had to know how big a test this game would be and how much Packers and Bears fans weigh this rivalry. Love (with help from Aaron Jones ) delivered time and time again in the second half. The victory was also a celebration of some of the Packers' young defenders. Devonte Wyatt and Quay Walker , often disappointing as rookies last season, had big moments . Rookies Lukas Van Ness and Karl Brooks also showed up . This game checked a lot of boxes."
2023,2,16,Atlanta Falcons,1-0,"The run-heavy script was what we expected. But it's a little concerning that, of the Falcons' 18 throws in their win Sunday , only four went to Kyle Pitts and Drake London . And that was against a Carolina defense that was missing its best corner for much of the game. Pitts logged a few big catches, plus a 26-yarder called back on a London penalty, and running backs Tyler Allgeier and Bijan Robinson really looked great together. But otherwise, the offense didn't get it done. It was Week 1, sure, but even the respected O-line was a mixed bag. Desmond Ridder also didn't do much to quiet any doubters. The defense played great -- really, that unit won the game. Can the Falcons expect outstanding showings from Jessie Bates and Grady Jarrett every week? They might have to."
2023,2,17,Minnesota Vikings,0-1,"For all the encouraging signs Brian Flores' undermanned defense showed against Tampa Bay , the Vikings still couldn't take the ball away or get a crucial stop late. In the end, three offensive turnovers cost them dearly. Perhaps it's a sign that this year's Minnesota squad won't have the same fortune as the 2022 edition, which thrived in close-game situations. Then again, the Vikings almost won a game in which they were minus-3 in turnovers; teams that were minus-3 or worse in regular-season games in 2022 went 1-37. This was not a great Week 1 showing, but I am not ready to write this team off, either. It's just that there are enough tough games upcoming that it's hard not to be somewhat uneasy."
2023,2,18,Seattle Seahawks,0-1,"I donât know what it is about the Seahawks over the past few years, but it seems like once they patch one defensive hole, another leak springs. Last year, the run defense was that unitâs Achillesâ heel. In Week 1 against the Rams , the run defense was fine (except maybe in short yardage). The problem? Stopping the pass. Seattle allowed a Cooper Kupp -less Los Angeles offense to average nearly 9 yards per pass attempt. It looked like the Rams tried to spread the Seahawks out and make it a matchup game. Offensively, Seattle started out fine but completely fizzled after its defense blocked a field goal late in the second quarter. There was a lot to process from this game, but Sean McVayâs Rams have traditionally given Pete Carrollâs teams trouble, so I am not panicking -- yet."
2023,2,19,Pittsburgh Steelers,0-1,"Well, this didn't go as planned. The white-hot first-team offense we saw in the preseason was completely smothered early and only looked efficient for one have-to-have-it drive before halftime of Sunday's loss to the Niners . Kenny Pickett , who pledged to take a big step up this season, had two picks -- and he should have had a third, but Fred Warner just dropped a gift that hit him in the hands . Pickett's final stats (31-of-46 passing, 232 yards) put a cosmetic sheen on what was a bad day. His offensive line (he was sacked five times) and receivers (countless communication errors) did little to help. The run game was virtually abandoned after the early deficit was established. Sign of trouble or a one-game blip? Next Monday's game against the Browns, who dominated the Bengals defensively, will tell us a lot about the 2023 Steelers' offense."
2023,2,20,Denver Broncos,0-1,"The Broncos looked like a slightly cleaner version of what they were a year ago in Sundayâs loss to the Raiders . (Yes, I realize thatâs about as nice a compliment as âyouâve lost some weight!â) But ultimately, they lost another game they had ample chances to win -- a theme that was drilled home time after painful time last season. The lack of trustworthy weaponry worries me. Russell Wilson started the game cleanly, hitting 17 of his first 19 passes with two TDs, yet the Broncos ran out of gas thereafter. Ten penalties certainly hurt, but the lack of big-play threats with WR Jerry Jeudy sidelined for this game and TE Greg Dulcich knocked out with an injury felt stark. This wasnât a horrific start for the Sean Payton era, but it felt similar to an era most Broncos fans want to forget."
2023,2,21,Washington Commanders,1-0,"It wasnât the start Sam Howell and the offense wanted, especially in terms of pass protection. Turnovers, penalties and sacks were huge bugaboos in Week 1 against a rebuilding Cardinals team, yet Washington escaped with a four-point edge . Thatâs worrisome, but not yet a travesty. The offensive line, Howell and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy all can share some blame for the pass-pro mistakes. The Commandersâ defense showed it can take over games, but asking for that every week likely wonât fly for very long."
2023,2,22,Tennessee Titans,0-1,"I have an enormous amount of respect for the way Mike Vrabel coaches, especially when it comes to in-game decision-making. So, when Vrabel opted to kick a field goal down four points on fourth-and-6 from the New Orleans 11-yard line with 2:20 remaining, it stunned me. Next Gen Stats favored going for it over kicking the field goal by 5.9 percentage points. The Saints drained the rest of the clock on the ensuing possession and earned a 16-15 victory . Vrabel also declined a holding penalty on a third-down play in the third quarter, giving the Saints a 52-yard field goal try (which they made) to tie the game instead of pushing them back 10 yards for another third-down play. Didnât love that, either. Even after listening to him explain the decisions on Monday , I felt like these were head-scratchers from an otherwise very good game-managing coach."
2023,2,23,Las Vegas Raiders,1-0,"It was an ugly win against Denver, no doubt, but I think what resonated most for me was the Raiders' grit and resolve in tough spots. That's exactly what they lacked last year. Heck, go back and look at the first month of the 2022 season, and you'll see they lost four of their first five games by a total of 14 points. On Sunday, from the final minute of the first quarter on, no team led by more than 6 points. The Raiders kept tradition alive by committing 10 penalties, several of them hair-pullingly maddening, and Jimmy Garoppolo 's red-zone pick was a killer. But it's what the Raiders did after those mistakes that defined them in this game. It was a gutsy performance littered with reminders that living this dangerously every week will eventually come back to bite them."
2023,2,24,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,1-0,"Tampa Bay was lucky to not be behind at halftime of Sunday's win over Minnesota, thanks to three Kirk Cousins turnovers. Those takeaways only led to 3 points for the Bucs, but they did keep the Vikings off the scoreboard at least twice . Tampa's wide receivers stepped up in a big way, and offensive coordinator Dave Canales seemed dialed in late in his first game calling plays. But the offensive line and Baker Mayfield must improve going forward. Luke Goedeke and Robert Hainsey were flagged for holding, and Tristan Wirfs had a so-so day in his debut at left tackle. Mayfield got better as the game went on, and he avoided some would-be sacks, but his overall execution's lacking. His receivers bailed him out a few times."
2023,2,25,New England Patriots,0-1,"The Week 1 loss to the Eagles felt eerily similar to the Patriots' late-season defeat to the Bengals in 2022, in which New England fell behind 22-0 before coming up just short in a 22-18 final . Against Philadelphia, the early deficit was 16-0, and the final margin was 25-20. To me, these are testaments to Bill Belichick and his staff game-planning for a top-tier opponent very effectively, but they're also coming up short because of the talent differential. Yes, the Patriots were one Kayshon Boutte foot from perhaps winning the game. And though the Pats made up for lost time offensively, they must quickly find a way to avoid slow starts, or this team could find itself in holes it can't dig out of."
2023,2,26,Los Angeles Rams,1-0,"Sean McVay delivered a relative masterpiece of found art , if you will, leading a Cooper Kupp -less offense to a fairly dominant performance that saw the Rams control the ball for nearly 40 minutes with long, sustained drives -- and a few out-of-character wrinkles, to boot. Without Kupp, Los Angeles opted for more gap runs and power plays, and though 37 handoffs only netted 81 rush yards, the ground game served its purpose: keeping the Seahawks' offense off the field. The Rams also found a pretty good Kupp doppelgÃ¤nger in rookie Puka Nacua , who had 10 catches (on 15 targets) for 119 yards, including a diving grab on the sideline to help ice the game late. Defeating Seattle might have been a stunning result, but don't forget that this McVay guy can coach a little."
2023,2,27,Carolina Panthers,0-1,"There have been far worse first starts in the history of the NFL, but I honestly thought Bryce Young would play a tad better than he did in Sunday's loss to the Falcons. Jessie Bates baited him into two picks , in virtually the same way both times. Those should provide a good lesson for the rookie: He can't always get away with some of those tight-window throws he loves. Yet, it was pretty clear that the game was not too big for Young -- and that's what makes me confident he'll be fine. The No. 1 overall pick misfired on some passes, including what could have been a 99-yard TD to Jonathan Ming o , but that was one of the few times a receiver had clear separation. Young struggled, but his playmakers didn't do him a ton of favors. He should settle in with more help."
2023,2,28,New York Giants,0-1,"The Giants had the most disheartening Week 1 performance. At the center of the struggles in the 40-zip home loss to Dallas : the team's past two first-round picks, its $40 million quarterback and the franchise-tagged running back. The Cowboys' pick-six off Saquon Barkley 's hands really set the tone for a dismal night. Daniel Jones was sacked seven times and didn't complete a pass longer than 9 yards until Dallas was up 26-0. This year's first-rounder, CB Deonte Banks , left the game with cramps, and one of last year's first-rounders, Evan Neal , was worked over in pass pro. If you're a Giants fan, maybe you take solace in the fact that the 2022 Vikings lost 40-3 to the Cowboys at home last season before finishing 13-4. Or maybe you start worrying about four of the Giants' next five games being on the road."
2023,2,29,Chicago Bears,0-1,"There weren't a ton of positives to take away from the opener, which ended in a ninth straight loss to Green Bay. Justin Fields wasn't bad , per se, but he was hardly great -- and the overall offensive struggles were such that any offseason optimism anyone might have been feeling was severely tamped down. Netting 6 points on the first three possessions hurt, as the Bears turned the ball over on downs and got bogged down twice deep in Green Bay territory. The offensive line was a sieve. There were five offensive penalties. And Fields threw a horrific pick-six late that sealed it. On top of that, Chicago's defense fell flat, too: The Bears were inconsistent with their pass rush and coverage, generated zero turnovers and executed poorly on third and fourth down. There was more bad here than I imagined the Bears having in Week 1."
2023,2,30,Indianapolis Colts,0-1,"Anthony Richardson 's first NFL start was an interesting Rorschach test, simultaneously providing encouragement and a reminder of how far he and the Colts still must come. Elements of the Jalen Hurts playbook that made Shane Steichen a hot coaching candidate were on display, notably with Richardson's TD draw play . But part of what was missing was the downfield passing. Most of Richardson's throws were quick, and 136 of his 223 passing yards came after the catch. He also dealt with a knee injury (suffered in the first quarter ) and ankle injury on Sunday, coming out of the game in the final minute. Richardson's running ability was as advertised, and there were impressive throws scattered throughout, but you can tell this offense is in its developmental infancy."
2023,2,31,Houston Texans,0-1,"C.J. Stroud made a respectable debut on Sunday , considering what he was up against. The Ravens' rush was in his face most of the day, as he took five sacks and spun out of at least that many more. Stroud showed good athleticism and escapability, even if the offensive line's performance makes you worry about Stroud getting hurt and, given the number of mistakes that unit made, wonder how productive he can be. Once Stroud settled in around the second quarter, there were some promising throws and plays -- just not enough to compensate. The Texans need to insulate Stroud better, but I think I underestimated how important a guy like Robert Woods is going to be for the No. 2 overall pick this season. More than once on Sunday, the savvy Woods saved his QB's bacon by coming back to the ball or catching a pass that could have been picked. All in all, a solid Game 1, but it also served as a reminder of how far this team still needs to go."
2023,2,32,Arizona Cardinals,0-1,"Defensively, the Cardinals did everything one could have hoped for in the loss to Washington , holding the Commanders to 248 yards and a 4-of-12 conversion rate on third downs, forcing three turnovers and sacking Sam Howell six times. But it wasn't enough, as the offense -- creative as it might have been -- just couldn't sustain drives with placeholder QB Joshua Dobbs . Arizona tried throwing the kitchen sink at Washington with a Hollywood Brown end-around , a Rondale Moore wheel route and a flurry of formations and personnel groupings. And the offense totaled 210 yards and 13 first downs. Penalties also killed the Cardinals in all three phases. If Arizona wants to try to win games with good defense and not much offense, it can't be flagged nine times for 122 yards next week -- or any week."
2023,3,1,San Francisco 49ers,2-0,"Beating the Rams was a gut-check win in a lot of ways, even if a few big missed connections could have made it a larger margin of victory. Some will hone in on the Brock Purdy overthrows, but he came through with the touchdown drive before halftime and delivered some big throws on the fourth-quarter TD march. Iâm not worried about him. But the health of the secondary is getting a little scary. The Niners were paper-thin by gameâs end, but credit goes to Isaiah Oliver , who was thrust into a major role because of injuries, and Deommodore Lenoir , who left the game for a bit before making a pick late . Both came up huge. In lieu of style points, San Francisco won with resolve, keeping Kyle Shanahan's bunch at No. 1."
2023,3,2,Kansas City Chiefs,1-1,"I heard some chirping about my decision to drop the Chiefs only one spot in these rankings after they lost in Week 1 . My defense of that move started and ended with Travis Kelce and Chris Jones . They were back on the field in Week 2, and they each made their imprint on the gutsy win at Jacksonville . Kelce scored on what looked like a blowing-off-steam drive, and Jones had multiple huge plays: a fourth-down sack , another half sack and a batted pass , in addition to multiple pressures against the Jaguarsâ Anton Harrison . Having those two playing allowed Patrick Mahomes to have a merely mortal game, and the Chiefs secured a big win. They arenât going anywhere for now."
2023,3,3,Philadelphia Eagles,2-0,"Even if the Eagles havenât fully hit their stride offensively, DâAndre Swift's breakout game in the 34-28 win over the Vikings was a pleasant development, posing an interesting backfield challenge once Kenneth Gainwell is fully healthy. It stood out to me that the offensive line seemed out of sync in pass protection vs. Minnesota, almost forcing the run-heavy drive that seemed to light a fire under the offense. That unit should be fine. But the banged-up secondary will need every extra minute of rest before Mondayâs game against the 2-0 Bucs ."
2023,3,4,Dallas Cowboys,2-0,"The Cowboys have their best scoring margin through two games since the 1970 merger (a whopping +60 points), even better than in the Super Bowl seasons of 1971 and 1995. Defensively, theyâre pretty bonkers, forcing seven turnovers and allowing one touchdown in 120 minutes of football. The offense clearly can do more, only converting half its red-zone possessions into touchdowns. But for as many nits as we can pick on that side of the ball, the balance has been good. The physicality has been excellent. The efficiency has been very solid. Itâs hard to complain about what Mike McCarthy and Brian Schottenheimer have schemed up, even if the passing game has been a little safe with big leads."
2023,3,5,Miami Dolphins,2-0,"Theyâre 2-0, with nine home games remaining. Each of the first two contests required late gut checks. The fourth-quarter interception against the Patriots was regrettable, and there were a few underthrows, but Tua Tagovailoa played a pretty darned composed game. He knew heâd have to be patient and take his second and third options, and he routinely did that. Add in the Dolphinsâ terrific yards after first contact -- especially via Raheem Mostert and Jaylen Waddle -- and this offense looks tough to deal with. Mike McDaniel schemed up a really nice game against the Patriots, as did Vic Fangio defensively. The special-teams errors added a few items to the clean-up list, but Miami once more impressed against a conference opponent away from home."
2023,3,6,Buffalo Bills,1-1,"The win over the Raiders was exactly the kind of performance Bills fans wanted to see after the meltdown in Week 1 . Josh Allen made his standard share of freewheeling plays ( the TD pass to Khalil Shakir , my goodness), but he didnât play fast and loosely like he did against the Jets. Allen avoided the facepalm turnovers and mostly took the little gains the Raiders gave him, which allowed those moments of pure improvisational beauty -- later, the third-and-6 connection with Gabe Davis for 40 yards -- to arrive more organically. And even with inconsistent pressure, the defense was more than up to the challenge, holding Las Vegas to 10 points and forcing three turnovers. That is more like what I expected from Buffalo coming into the season."
2023,3,7,Baltimore Ravens,2-0,"The Ravensâ defense came up with timely stops in Week 2 , and extra credit goes to an undermanned cornerback group that held up extremely well against the Bengalsâ skill-position talent. It really was encouraging that the new offense found a way to finish off a big game with some old-school Ravens power. Todd Monken's attack fed multiple mouths, with nine players receiving three or more touches, and Baltimoreâs heavy sets ground down the Bengalsâ front. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Running the ball as well as the Ravens did without J.K. Dobbins sent a clear message to the rest of the AFC: Theyâre not stopping Baltimore's ground game anytime soon."
2023,3,8,Detroit Lions,1-1,"After all the feel-good stories in Week 1, the Lions were served a dish of Week 2 â humble pie ,â as Dan Campbell said, and I wonât lull you to sleep with the narrative that the loss to the Seahawks will be good for them. Iâm a believer that losses should be avoided at all costs, although I understand the sentiment. If the Lions watch the game tape and feel the same way I do -- that the loss to Seattle hit too close to home, vis-a-vis the Lions that started last season 1-6 -- then maybe it will serve its purpose. But as prepared as the Lions looked for the Chiefs in Week 1 , they looked just that unprepared in key moments against Seattle. The fight was there, but crisp execution wasnât. And now it appears theyâll have to regroup without C.J. Gardner-Johnson , who is out indefinitely with a potentially torn pectoral , per NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo."
2023,3,9,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-1,"Itâs surprising that a team with Trevor Lawrence , Calvin Ridley , Travis Etienne , Christian Kirk , Evan Engram and Zay Jones can go 3-for-12 on third downs in back-to-back games. It might be reasonably excused against what looks like a pretty good Chiefs defense . But when you plop an 0-for-3 red-zone performance on top of it, well, you just canât have that. Itâs easy to look at the new play-caller , but I donât think Press Taylor is a fair scapegoat, even if the only memorable conversion was Lawrence ad-libbing on his TD pass to Ridley against the Colts in Week 1. The offensive line needs to pick it up these next two games without the suspended Cam Robinson ."
2023,3,10,New Orleans Saints,2-0,"The Saints went the first 118-plus minutes of the season without allowing a touchdown -- against the Panthers on Monday, they became the final NFL team to surrender one this season. That's a testament to how good their defense is, but it's been a lot more effort on offense. Depending on the severity of the Jamaal Williams injury, New Orleans could be a little shorthanded in Green Bay on Sunday , with Alvin Kamara still suspended for another game. Tony Jones Jr. gave the Saints a spark in short-yardage situations, but they might need more big pass plays like the ones they got from Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed late in Week 2. You can see Derek Carr 's frustration at times, but this passing game is still getting its timing down."
2023,3,11,New York Jets,1-1,"Sundayâs loss to the Cowboys was an indication of the clear limitations of the Jetsâ Aaron Rodgers -less offense when facing a top-tier defense. The offensive line was manhandled, and the run game erased. Zach Wilson ended up leading the Jets in rushing with 36 yards. Garrett Wilson broke free for their one big play of the game offensively, but the rest was frustrating to watch. Meanwhile, I was really shocked to see the Cowboysâ offense milling the Jetsâ defense into grist for four quarters. If the Jets canât keep tough games close, winning without Rodgers will be a massive chore. The Jets came to Zach Wilsonâs defense after Week 2 , which is nice. But will it matter if the other 52 players on the roster donât do their part on the field?"
2023,3,12,Cincinnati Bengals,0-2,"Youâll be reminded multiple times this week that last yearâs Bengals started 0-2, too, and itâs fair to look back. Heck, the 2021 team was 1-1 to start, with an overtime win over a so-so Vikings team and still made the Super Bowl. However, my panic meter is not insanely low because there are some unpleasant realities this team absolutely must address. The two supposed bedrocks entering the season were supposed to be the passing game and the front seven on defense. Both have severely underachieved. Joe Burrow âs calf injury gives the offense some cover, but what is the defenseâs excuse? Failing to get off the field on several third-and-short plays will be the lasting memory of Sunday's loss to the Ravens ."
2023,3,13,Cleveland Browns,1-1,"The awful Nick Chubb injury cloaks everything right now. You just can't replace Chubb, although Jerome Ford showed real heart Monday night. What worries me is that Chubb's absence puts more on Deshaun Watson and the pass protection. Two of Watson's three turnovers were returned for touchdowns , vaulting a stagnant Steelers offense to victory. Deshaun's interception might go down as a ""drop,"" but the ball was not well-thrown. His first fumble was huge, until his defense bailed him out . No such luck on the second one. Some of his throws were wildly off-target. And what's up with 30 penalty yards from the quarterback? The whole situation just gives me the willies right now, even if this defense deserves a lot of credit."
2023,3,14,Atlanta Falcons,2-0,"That's two home victories against teams breaking in new quarterbacks in two weeks. But Atlanta has a newish QB, as well, and the Falcons have now won four straight games started by Desmond Ridder . He threw his first career interception and frankly should have had two more (one a potential pick-six, the other in Green Bay's end zone). But Ridder found answers on Sunday, both as a runner (posting 39 rushing yards and a crucial fourth-down TD run ) and thrower. There was some trust on two big passes in the fourth: the 45-yard flea flicker to Mack Hollins and the 24-yard dart to Drake London that set up the go-ahead field goal. There's room to grow, but Ridder made his biggest plays when his team needed them most."
2023,3,15,Seattle Seahawks,1-1,"Not only did the Seahawks avoid an 0-2 start, but they also turned in a pretty impressive game on the road against a Lions team coming off its biggest win in forever. This was a giant victory for Seattle. I was prepared to write that critical penalties were the Seahawks' undoing had they lost, but Geno Smith -- outside of that wild sack he took -- and the defense both came up big when they had to. They deserve kudos for defeating that offense without Riq Woolen . Devon Witherspoon had a few big plays (and a few tough moments) in his NFL debut. Tre Brown came out of nowhere to log a career day . Week 1 isn't forgotten, but it's forgiven."
2023,3,16,Los Angeles Chargers,0-2,"If youâve watched either of the Chargersâ two losses, you might have noticed they really havenât been a function of poor effort. Itâs a matter of straight-up execution mistakes. Time and time again. Almost always at the worst possible moments. And while the offense isnât completely off the hook (too many sacks and settling for short field goals), itâs really the defense that has been the bigger problem. At least the pass rush woke up (five sacks at Tennessee ), but that doesnât make up for the fact that the Bolts have been bombarded by deep passes. Itâs a maddening storyline that wonât evaporate until the defense proves it can stop someone."
2023,3,17,Pittsburgh Steelers,1-1,"Pittsburgh's defense just rescued the team from an 0-2 start at home. But watching the passing game just labor for such long stretches, it makes you wonder why the timing is so off. Is it all on Kenny Pickett ? Not sure, but he clearly misfired on passes where there were plays to be made. The touchdown to George Pickens is why I can't completely quit Pickett. He's tough and competitive, and I'm not sure how he stayed in the game after the hit he took on that throw. Yet, it's still not good enough. The Steelers are going to have to find a way to showcase Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris a bit more. And while we're at it, is Pat Freiermuth still on the roster?"
2023,3,18,Green Bay Packers,1-1,"It didnât exactly feel like the Packers blew Sundayâs game against the Falcons , but they led by 12 points with 12 minutes left. And though it felt like Jordan Love getting the ball back with 57 seconds remaining and a chance to win it would be the real start of his legend in Green Bay, that wasnât meant to be. There were plenty of Packers deficiencies in the game (ahem, run defense), but for as well as Love played, he and the offense stalled late with a reasonable chance to win. After a slow start, Love led the Packers on four straight scoring drives (not counting the end-of-half kneel-down) in the second and third quarters. In the fourth quarter, Green Bayâs offense totaled 7 net yards on 10 plays."
2023,3,19,Washington Commanders,2-0,"The Commanders are 2-0 for the first time in a dozen years. Coming back from down 18 on the road and going on a 32-6 scoring run are pretty positive signs; Sunday's win over Denver was far more impressive than the smaller comeback against the lesser Cardinals at home in Week 1 . Washington has played better in the second halves of games than in the first. That pattern might work against Arizona and Denver, but will it stand up against the Bills in Week 3? What gives the Commanders a chance is the play of Sam Howell . Kid has some guts, doesn't he? After some empty series early, he was battered around, but Howell was dialed in down the stretch, confidently leading five scoring drives in the final 32 minutes."
2023,3,20,Tennessee Titans,1-1,"What they lacked in big or timely plays in the opener , the Titans made up for in Sunday's dramatic OT victory over the Chargers . It was a shorthanded effort, too. Tennessee was without two starting DBs and OG Peter Skoronski , this year's first-round pick, and the team had to replace Skoronski's replacement midgame . Perhaps this classic Mike Vrabel win is a sign of things to come. The Titans trailed by 11 points for 67 seconds of game time against the Chargers; otherwise, every Titans play this season has come in a one-score scenario. They have to win with guile and toughness and via special teams, and they came through in spades on Sunday. So did Ryan Tannehill , whose success should be huge for his confidence and the confidence of everyone else in the passing game. This team can make a run at the Jaguars."
2023,3,21,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2-0,"Mike Evans is still dusting defensive backs. Shaquil Barrett remains a backfield wrecker. Baker Mayfield is out there slinging tough passes and barreling for first downs as a runner. Who are these guys? Well, the 2-0 Bucs are in some ways who theyâve been, even as the Tom Brady-led teams naturally kept their identity under his umbrella. But the way Mayfield is playing -- fearlessly and decisively -- makes me think this team should compete in the wide-open NFC South. Mayfield has always had the ability to make game-changing plays, but his negative ones seemed to sting a bit more in the past. Through two games, however, heâs taken one sack (spinning out of several) and thrown zero interceptions. Thatâs a winning formula."
2023,3,22,Minnesota Vikings,0-2,"In two games, the Vikings have handed off 26 times, netting a total of 69 yards, with a long run of 9 yards. According to Next Gen Stats, only 30.8 percent of those runs were deemed successful. They've only attempted four runs in 30 fourth-quarter plays. One, a 3-yard loss on first-and-goal from the 1. Another, a Kirk Cousins scramble. The other two were 6- and 7-yard gains from Alexander Mattison . Maybe Mattison's early fumble against the Eagles killed off any designs on running the ball. Or perhaps the Eagles' front did that by itself. But two weeks into the season, this Vikings team is flawed offensively: too dependent on throwing to Justin Jefferson , and not good enough on the ground."
2023,3,23,Denver Broncos,0-2,"Denver is one of two 0-2 teams to have lost both contests at home, along with New England. The Broncos' losses have been by 1 and 2 points . It feels like they were a few plays away from being 2-0, but you can't overlook the fact that the Broncos were up 21-3 Sunday with the ball on the Washington 40-yard line midway through the second quarter. From there, Washington put up 18 straight points (and it should have been more), as Denver's offense froze and the defense allowed scoring chances on six straight possessions. Russell Wilson 's second-quarter fumble and third-quarter interception sandwiched a pair of three-and-outs. Sean Payton's postgame comments seemed to center around Wilson and the offense. Where this thing goes is anyone's guess, but the road to the playoffs is longer now."
2023,3,24,Los Angeles Rams,1-1,"Some Rams fans nudged me about ranking this team 26th last week, and you know what? I agree with them, even after a loss. I didn't trust what I saw in Week 1's win over the Seahawks, but Sunday's showing in a loss to San Francisco confirmed a few things: Sean McVay can still coach. Matthew Stafford still has it (even taking into account the second-half picks). The Puka Nacua hype is for real . Nacua's talent was never really in question. He was a four-star recruit who made big plays at Washington and BYU, and in the Senior Bowl. The question was his health. But if that holds up, adding him to the mix with Cooper Kupp (once he returns to the lineup ) might be even better than cloning Kupp. The Rams are far from perfect, but I highly underestimated many aspects of this roster."
2023,3,25,New England Patriots,0-2,"The Patriots are 0-2 with a pair of home losses against two possible (likely?) playoff teams, but spinning a ""they could be 2-0"" narrative would seem odd to me. Is a team with a piecemeal offensive line and a penchant for falling into double-digit holes worthy of such respect? Sure, we're only two games into the season, but how has this been any different from the past few campaigns in New England? The Patriots came back from big deficits only to suffer close losses last season, too (against the Raiders in Week 15 and the Bengals in Week 16 ), and it was hard to cull major positives from either those games or this year's defeats. There has just been a dark cloud following this team for some time now. As in their games, the Pats face a steep climb back to contention. Again."
2023,3,26,Las Vegas Raiders,1-1,"Well, the first drive looked promising. Then the Raiders got smacked in the face repeatedly, being outscored 38-3 over the final 57-plus minutes in their loss to the Bills . Jimmy Garoppolo wasnât under a ton of pressure on Sunday, but when he was, bad things happened. Josh Jacobs somehow ran for -2 yards, as six of his nine rush attempts went for zero yards or fewer. Thatâs not a good look for the offensive line or the offense as a whole. As great as Davante Adams might be, the rest of this Raiders offense didnât produce enough worthy plays while it was a close game (outside of Tre Tucker âs 34-yard end around ). Plus, losing the turnover battle 3-0 on the road rarely works out well. Back to the drawing board."
2023,3,27,Carolina Panthers,0-2,"By the time the Panthers were able to get Jonathan Mingo involved and Bryce Young finally settled down against New Orleans , it was too late. The 0-2 start isn't shocking, but it has to be disappointing, because Carolina was in both games in the fourth quarter. Frank Reich told us to have patience, and we certainly do, but that's now two touchdowns in 23 offensive drives. It's not all on Young, but his three turnovers in two games could have been avoided. There's a foundation here, and the defense played pretty well again. Still, Carolina is stuck in the mud a bit for now, until the passing game starts humming."
2023,3,28,New York Giants,1-1,"Through their first 90 minutes of football this season, the Giants were outscored 60-zip by their opponents, putting them in serious danger of occupying the 32nd slot on this list. Over the next 30 minutes against Arizona , the Giants outscored the Cardinals by 23, giving them one of the biggest comeback wins in franchise history. Big Blue hadn't overcome a 21-point deficit since the 1940s. But the triumphant vibes were short-lived; Saquon Barkley suffered an ankle injury after fueling the rally with two second-half scores. It's a game the Giants probably felt they had to have, given the short turnaround for Thursday's matchup in San Francisco -- after all, 0-3 starts and playoff berths are rare dance partners."
2023,3,29,Chicago Bears,0-2,"That's now 12 straight losses for the Bears, if you're scoring at home, and 16 losses in their 19 games with Matt Eberflus and Justin Fields together. The coach and quarterback are certainly not the only issues with this team -- anyone being honest should realize this. The Bears expected to be better this season, but there's no clear evidence of that yet. They've allowed the second-most points and are near the bottom of the passing-efficiency metrics (6.5 yards per attempt, three INTs, sack rate of 13.2%). It's Year 2 for Eberflus and Year 3 for Fields. They can turn things around. But will they?"
2023,3,30,Indianapolis Colts,1-1,"You have to be encouraged by -- and concerned with -- Anthony Richardson through two games. He hasn't looked overwhelmed facing NFL defenses, he's thrown some really nice passes and he's been dangerous as a runner, scoring three TDs and averaging 5.8 yards per carry. But he's also left two straight games with injury. In Week 1, he left late with a knee injury, and in Week 2, he landed in the concussion protocol . Gardner Minshew did what a good backup should, helping pad the lead he inherited, but the Colts want Richardson be out there -- and they surely want him to protect himself better. If he can cut down on the injuries, Indy might really have something. For now, though, an impressive win is marred by a smidge of fear."
2023,3,31,Houston Texans,0-2,"There's only so much silver lining a franchise can inlay after an 0-2 start, which was preceded by 11 victories over the previous three seasons. But it's hard not to give Houston credit for fighting back against the Colts with a group that entered the game missing both starting safeties, both starting tackles and two interior O-linemen (and replacement safety Eric Murray was hurt on Sunday). Probably the brightest part of the 31-20 loss was rookie QB C.J. Stroud , who gutted through a right shoulder injury throughout. He overcame an early fumble to throw for 384 yards and two TDs despite taking six sacks and at least nine hits. But can the Texans protect him? That's what has to keep DeMeco Ryans up at night."
2023,3,32,Arizona Cardinals,0-2,"The Cardinals did more offensively in the first half against the Giants than they did over four quarters in the Week 1 loss to the Commanders. That was the good news. The bad? Despite leading 20-0 at halftime and 28-7 midway through the third quarter, Arizona collapsed in the second half. The defense was asked to play a lot more after halftime because the offense went stagnant after a third-quarter TD, going scoreless and netting just 73 yards and three first downs in the final 24-plus minutes of the game. Still, the run game improved, and Joshua Dobbs had some really nice moments. The Cardinals might be better than I realized in some respects, but they also blew a three-TD lead in the final 20 minutes."
2023,4,1,Miami Dolphins,3-0,"We should have guessed that a team averaging 30 points and 462.5 yards of offense per game on the road would really be able to cook at home. But 70 points ? And 726 yards?! Imagine what the Dolphins would have done with Jaylen Waddle on the field . New England holding Miami to 389 yards and 24 points in Week 2 looks downright heroic now. Of course, the Pats barely saw De'Von Achane in that one. The rookie back hopped into a featured role Sunday and blasted off . Just what this offense needs: more speed. According to Next Gen Stats, Dolphins players are now responsible for the five fastest individual speeds recorded on a given play this season, with three by Tyreek Hill and one apiece from Achane and Raheem Mostert ."
2023,4,2,San Francisco 49ers,3-0,"The Giants apparently came into Thursday's matchup intending to blitz the holy heck out of Brock Purdy , and they certainly succeeded in doing that. Purdy was shaky early, but really adjusted to how quickly the defense was bearing down, making several big-time throws outside the numbers. Any team looking to mimic that defensive approach against the Niners is at risk of being carved up. All of it came without the injured Brandon Aiyuk , too, and in a short week. This team appears to be on the same plane right now as it has been in three of the four previous seasons (save for 2020). The upcoming part of the schedule (featuring the suddenly spunky Cardinals and resurgent Browns ) is more interesting than it looked previously, but three of the next five are at home before the Week 9 bye. Things are good."
2023,4,3,Kansas City Chiefs,2-1,"The Chiefs needed a game like they had Sunday, in which they rolled over the vulnerable Bears, following the Week 1 loss and a meat-grinder win in Week 2 . Patrick Mahomes dished the ball around like candy, while the run game was the best it has looked since the Super Bowl. And the defense! The Chiefs have allowed four TDs this season: one was a pick-six in Week 1, and one was a garbage-time score Sunday. You'd like to see the receivers keep stepping up, and Jawaan Taylor 's struggles are concerning, even if Andy Reid thinks the refs need to chill a bit on his new right tackle. But this is still a pretty complete football team that can clean your clock almost any given week."
2023,4,4,Philadelphia Eagles,3-0,"I really like how Joe Buck phrased it late in Philadelphia's victory on Monday Night Football : ""The Eagles have shown a lot of what they can do, not all of it."" That really summed up Philly's past two games to me: The offensive advances were clear, but even with two beefy, productive outings, better is entirely possible. The pass protection was improved against the Bucs, and A.J. Brown clearly thrived in a featured role, if there was ever a worry there. But the lack of red-zone efficiency added a new wrinkle; you'd love to see Nick Sirianni be a little more creative down there instead of having the Eagles just try to will their way into the end zone. But all in all, they're rounding into form."
2023,4,5,Buffalo Bills,2-1,"Though it seemed to get a bit lost in the Sunday shuffle (perhaps because people hadn't respected what the Commanders accomplished earlier this season), the Bills put together a really impressive statement performance , outclassing previously unbeaten Washington for four quarters. Buffalo's defensive line overwhelmed the Commanders' offensive line, generating pressure on nearly two-thirds of pass plays that didn't feature a blitz. The Bills' offensive line was equally dominant, giving Josh Allen mostly clean pockets. But the biggest development might have been what Allen did as a scrambler: taking slides and protecting the ball better. If the Bills play like this in all three phases, they are really tough to beat. Week 1 feels like a distant memory."
2023,4,6,Dallas Cowboys,2-1,"Well, now we know what it looks like when Dallas has a bad day on both sides of the ball. Even with Trevon Diggs lost for the year , the Cowboys should not be having games like this going forward. It's easier to excuse the offensive issues, given the absence of three starting linemen. The defensive breakdowns in the first half were proof that a quality, creative offense can put this team in some uncomfortable spots, especially without Diggs on the field. The secondary, save for maybe Stephon Gilmore , had a tough game. There's no question this loss to Arizona dramatically changes my view of this team. Eventual Super Bowl winners have been known to put up a regular-season dud along the way, although seldom more than one."
2023,4,7,Detroit Lions,2-1,"I have a feeling the defense we saw getting worked over by Seattle in Week 2 is not going to be the unit we see for most of the season. The performance Aaron Glenn's unit put forth in Week 3 against Atlanta is more like it. Though the Falcons don't yet have a dominant offense, they pose unique challenges for many defenses. Atlanta tried attacking DBs Jerry Jacobs and Brian Branch after their Week 2 coverage challenges, but both stepped up and played well . In the Lions' first outing without C.J. Gardner-Johnson , Branch had a whale of a game; he could be one of this defense's most important players soon."
2023,4,8,Baltimore Ravens,2-1,"Not sure how to portray the OT loss to the Colts as anything but a concerning step backward. The Ravens looked confident for most of their first two offensive drives, drafting off a strong Week 2 performance -- but the tide turned three plays into Drive No. 2 with Kenyan Drake 's bad fumble . Lamar Jackson 's lack of ball security and backup center Sam Mustipher 's bad snap helped put the Colts in position to force overtime. It still feels a bit improbable that the Ravens actually lost. Jackson didn't record his first incompletion until the third quarter, and he ran for 101 yards and two scores. There were just so many missed opportunities, including a failure to secure Gardner Minshew 's first-half fumble, fair-catching the free kick that followed Minshew's safety late in regulation and failing to convert points on two overtime possessions that started near midfield."
2023,4,9,Cleveland Browns,2-1,"After a pretty tepid start offensively, including a truly bizarre backward pass by Deshaun Watson , the offense really turned in a solid day of work in the win over the Titans , with Watson settling down and having what was arguably his best game as a Brown. Once again, though, the defense established the tone and really never let up. Tennessee crossed midfield on all three second-quarter possessions but ended up with only three points. The Titans couldn't escape their own end of the field in the second half, netting just 26 yards and two first downs on 19 plays. The Browns clamped down (without CB Greg Newsome ). Cleveland's stars shined , and this team is back in business."
2023,4,10,Green Bay Packers,2-1,"The Packers trailed 17-0 in the fourth quarter, needing three scores and defensive stops to beat the Saints. They pulled it off despite having five significant players inactive and then losing LB De'Vondre Campbell to an ankle injury early on. Chalk this up as the best comeback of Jordan Love 's early career as Green Bay's starter, the fairytale ending that eluded him in Week 2 . Time after time, he made plays despite dealing with incomplete passes (including several drops) and offensive penalties throughout. Love received one game ball after the rousing victory; the other went to Rashan Gary , who had his best game since returning from a torn ACL suffered last season. Love and Gary simply willed the Packers to victory when hope was fleeting. This is a plucky team that deserves your attention."
2023,4,11,Cincinnati Bengals,1-2,"Joe Burrow gutted out Monday's (must?-)win over the Rams , working through a slow start to lead a massive touchdown drive on the Bengals' first possession of the third quarter. Ja'Marr Chase provided his first transcendent performance of the season (12 catches for 141 yards), but this Cincinnati victory was spearheaded by a defense that, frankly, got a little undressed by the Ravens in Week 2. The Rams made some noise on big pass plays, but the story of the game was the pressure applied by Trey Hendrickson and a really good Cincy front. If that group can take over games while the Bengals round into form offensively (and let Burrow heal), they might just be OK in the long run."
2023,4,12,Seattle Seahawks,2-1,"Love that Kenneth Walker III headlined the offensive attack in the win over Carolina . Glad to see Jason Myers snap out of his mini-funk. And it's always nice when the 12s throatily help the home team by inducing a slew of false starts. But are these injuries going to stop for Seattle? Riq Woolen , Jamal Adams and Coby Bryant were already inactive on Sunday. Then Dre'Mont Jones , Darrell Taylor and Week 2 hero Tre Brown were injured in the game, thinning the defense even more. If Woolen and Adams can return this week, I'll feel better about the secondary depth, but the Week 5 bye actually seems to land at a pretty good time."
2023,4,13,Jacksonville Jaguars,1-2,"Things went off the rails a bit in Sunday's 20-point home loss to the Texans. It would be foolish to overlook the biggest issues that have plagued the team to this point: third-down offense and pass defense. Third downs have been miserable for Jacksonville, which is converting just 29.7 percent of its attempts through three games. The Jaguars were only five-for-13 against Houston, with three of those conversions coming when they were down three scores, but that mark actually raised their third-down average. With all the weapons they have, that sort of performance is inexcusable. And on defense, Jacksonville can't seem to stop people unless the pass rush is heated up. That's understandable, given the fact that the unit is built around Josh Allen and Travon Walker , but the Jags' ability to apply pressure has cooled dramatically the past two games."
2023,4,14,New Orleans Saints,2-1,"I was struggling to overlook the Saints' O-line issues prior to Derek Carr suffering a shoulder injury that forced him to leave the Week 3 loss to Green Bay. There's no hiding those issues now. Carr's injury was not directly the fault of the Saints' line, but their offensive troubles start with that group. On Sunday, left tackle Trevor Penning was flagged twice and left guard James Hurst was flagged once. Center Erik McCoy and Hurst also had tough reps in pass protection. The entire unit struggled to generate any movement in the run game. And on top of all that, RG Cesar Ruiz left with a concussion. With Carr week to week , who knows how they'll block should Jameis Winston start at QB? The Saints suddenly are entering a gut-check phase after their 2-0 start."
2023,4,15,Los Angeles Chargers,1-2,"Even in a much-needed win , the Chargers left the door open for criticism with porous pass defense (again) and a questionable decision by Brandon Staley. Going for it on fourth-and-1 near his own end zone while leading by four late in the game was a wild risk, for sure; though his defense bailed him out , I wonder what the message would have been had it failed. Between that and Mike Williams ' season-ending ACL injury , it feels like the Chargers barely got to enjoy a road victory. All of this really overshadowed a special performance from Justin Herbert and Keenan Allen , doing it late without Williams or Austin Ekeler available. The Bolts host the Raiders this week, followed by the bye, which might not come at the worst time."
2023,4,16,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-1,"Both the offense and defense showed signs of improvement in the win over the Raiders . The defense let Davante Adams carve it up , with some of his catches wholly unimpeded. That's concerning. But the Steelers took Josh Jacobs out of the game, holding him to 62 rushing yards on 17 touches, and they forced Jimmy Garoppolo into enough mistakes that Las Vegas was limited to 18 points. And while coordinator Matt Canada surely still faces ire from some fans, the offensive design Sunday looked far better (even with that early fullback stuff ) than it had previously. Kenny Pickett threw more in-rhythm and found lesser-used targets -- Calvin Austin III and Pat Freiermuth -- for big plays while George Pickens received the star-wideout treatment from the Raiders. And now Pittsburgh is 2-1 after a terrible Week 1 ."
2023,4,17,Atlanta Falcons,2-1,"A team that drafted three skill-position players with top-10 picks over the past three years and fields the league's second-highest-paid offensive line is not supposed to put up just 119 yards of offense on its first nine possessions, even in a tough environment like what the Falcons faced Sunday in Detroit. Arthur Smith got away from the run too early in a tight game. Beyond that, though, Atlanta has displayed some passing-game shortcomings through three weeks. The fault is not all with Desmond Ridder , as the Falcons have been pretty conservative on first-half passes, and the pass protection has been surprisingly leaky at times. This was not a devastating loss , but Atlanta must address the offensive-identity element before long."
2023,4,18,New England Patriots,1-2,"Sundayâs win had to be so familiar to Patriots fans by now: ugly and against the Jets . Ugly got the job done, though. Even during the worst doldrums last season, the Pats knew what they were getting from Jakobi Meyers and Rhamondre Stevenson . So far, the Meyers-for- JuJu Smith-Schuster swap-out has been a net negative, and Stevenson hasnât been as decisive this season. The Patriots really need Mac Jones and Smith-Schuster to develop chemistry on the fly after the receiver missed a lot of on-field time this offseason. But they also need the offensive line to play better. This team is behind the sticks way too often."
2023,4,19,New York Jets,1-2,"Two humbling outings have washed away any thoughts that Zach Wilson could pick up where he left off in Week 1 , when he put forth a semi-encouraging performance following Aaron Rodgers ' Achilles tear. There were a lot of plays from Sunday's loss to New England that Wilson would absolutely want back. But I also came away from that game thinking the Jets almost outsmarted themselves by being too cautious until it was too late. Yes, it's tough to trust Wilson and that offensive line to a significant degree going forward. But what do the Jets have to lose, except games? They're already down their starting quarterback, and they're 1-2. Fortune favors the bold, and New York can't keep trying not to get beaten."
2023,4,20,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2-1,"With so many teams above them last week losing in Week 3, the Buccaneers actually rise despite a humbling game vs. Philadelphia. Mike Evans destroyed the Bears in Week 2 , then let a would-be touchdown bounce off his hands on Monday night. Baker Mayfield 's INT-less streak is over . Rachaad White lost a fumble and was taken down for a safety . Tampa Bay's offensive line was under siege all night. It was just one of those games. Mayfield battled, and the defense came up with some big stops in key spots, but the Bucs were actually a little fortunate the Eagles didn't hang 35-plus on them. Tampa might need to reevaluate the ground game a bit. White had no chance on a few runs, including the safety, and the offensive line has to shoulder some of this blame, but the Bucs are just not that efficient pounding the ball."
2023,4,21,Tennessee Titans,1-2,"Even while adding the context of how many good pass rushers the Titans have faced through three games, Andre Dillard had a rough day against the Brownsâ Myles Garrett , being overwhelmed in pass protection a few times and also being flagged on back-to-back third-down plays in the second quarter. He wasnât the only Tennessee offensive lineman to struggle at Cleveland , but itâs concerning that left tackle remains an issue -- and that coordinator Tim Kelly hasnât done more to help Dillard. Perhaps the Titans could try rookie Peter Skoronski there once heâs healthy, but Mike Vrabel stuck with 15-game starter Dennis Daley last season amid similar struggles. Tennessee might have to figure out how to make it work with Dillard."
2023,4,22,Washington Commanders,2-1,"It was surprising to see Sam Howell force as many bad passes and take as many sacks as he did against Buffalo , even taking into account his lack of experience (and knowing the biggest knock on him coming out of North Carolina was that he needed to feel pressure better). He straight up held onto the ball for ages on a few of his nine sacks Sunday, and while two of the four picks came with Washington facing a big deficit, this was as poorly as we've seen Howell play. It also should be concerning that both lines of scrimmage were owned by the Bills. Buffalo dominating Washington's O-line wasn't a shock. As for the Commanders' defensive line, though, Montez Sweat , Jonathan Allen and Chase Young generated some pressure, but it certainly wasn't enough to turn the game in Washington's favor."
2023,4,23,Houston Texans,1-2,"The win over the Jaguars was a true three-phase victory for the Texans and one of their most thoroughly impressive efforts in years. I saw the clear development of C.J. Stroud and the passing game, a defense that forced two timely turnovers (both corralled by Blake Cashman ) and special teams that blocked a field goal and ran back a kickoff for a touchdown . Stroud and fellow rookie Tank Dell forming such a strong early connection gives hope for something special in time. DeMeco Ryansâ defense might still be shorthanded, but the group battled all game. The young seeds of the roster really sprouted on Sunday, and itâs easy to see how Houston could be a very competitive team in time."
2023,4,24,Los Angeles Rams,1-2,"The Rams had to deal with a lot of offensive chaos up front against the Bengals, as both Alaric Jackson and Joe Noteboom were injured, and the patchwork line just couldn't handle Cincinnati's pass rush. Sean McVay dialed up some quality plays, and Matthew Stafford made some big throws, but the pressure was just too much. Not capitalizing on those early drives with touchdowns really came back to bite them. But even with Los Angeles' blocking issues, I couldn't knock this team down from last week. The Rams were competitive in a game the Bengals had to have, and the reality is that there's not much separating teams in the NFL's middle class so far this season."
2023,4,25,Arizona Cardinals,1-2,"The time is nigh for Drew Petzing to get some shine. A first-year offensive coordinator, Petzing has shown creativity and purpose in his game plans, especially early in contests during the scripted portions. That was clear against the Commanders and Giants , but it really became obvious against a Cowboys defense that had dominated its first two opponents. Joshua Dobbs and the read-option game neutralized Dallasâ pass rush early on and put the 'Boys on their heels. Dobbs has held up well and made the most of his chance as the starter, while players such as James Conner and Rondale Moore look reborn. This team has been a lot better than I imagined it would be early, so credit where itâs due: Jonathan Gannon is off to a solid start."
2023,4,26,Minnesota Vikings,0-3,"Is the season over? No, but itâs getting late early. Brian Floresâ defense had acquitted itself fairly respectably in the first two games, even if the limitations were obvious. On Sunday , the unit was diced up by Justin Herbert and Co., unable to pressure him enough or cover on the back end. The Chargers threw 48 passes -- 41 were completed, and Vikings DBs batted away only three throws. Actually, Akayleb Evans could have made it four, but his deflected pass went right to Joshua Palmer for a TD . That was bad luck, but the reality of the situation is that the defense has little chance to hang with elite offenses."
2023,4,27,Las Vegas Raiders,1-2,"If there was one play that summed up the frustration with the Raiders -- other than Josh McDanielsâ late decision to kick a field goal -- it would be Jimmy Garoppolo âs second interception Sunday night against the Steelers . Garoppolo waited and waited for either Davante Adams or Jakobi Meyers to shake loose from bracket coverage ... but it never happened. Garoppolo tried to ad lib and lobbed a pass over Meyersâ head, which was intercepted . Right now, the Raidersâ offense has gone from too Josh Jacobs -reliant last season to being too bent on jamming the ball into one of Vegas' talented receivers. All while Garoppolo (NFL-high six INTs) and the offensive line turn in uneven performances. This is a formula that needs fixing."
2023,4,28,Indianapolis Colts,2-1,"It would have been easy to look at the Colts to start the season, especially after the Jonathan Taylor drama crested, and wonder if last yearâs nightmare ever ended. But since the competitive loss in Week 1 , the Colts have won impressively on the road in back-to-back games . The Utah duo of Zack Moss and Matt Gay was heroic in the overtime win at Baltimore , but so was a defense that made big stops and cranked up the pressure. The big surprise Sunday was how much the Colts blitzed (40% blitz rate), something they typically do more selectively. But these are important victories for a club that's had to repeatedly lick its wounds in recent years. The Colts are growing thicker skin now."
2023,4,29,New York Giants,1-2,"With two humbling losses sandwiching a miraculous comeback win , the Giants require some soul-searching ahead of more tough games. The road back to the playoffs was always going to be rumbly, but I canât imagine the G-Men went into the season thinking it would be quite this laborious. The Giants have been making it tougher on themselves with poor tackling and a -5 turnover differential. It looked like multiple Giants missed tackles last Thursday , and they have yet to force a turnover this season. That wonât play against lesser teams, much less against a dangerous 49ers squad. The offensive issues are pretty stark, but the defensive inefficiency is nearly as disturbing."
2023,4,30,Carolina Panthers,0-3,"It might have been a little alarming to see the Panthersâ passing game humming the way it did on Sunday with Andy Dalton and without Bryce Young , despite all the false-start penalties incurred and pressure Seattle applied. I expect the Panthers to go back to Young whenever heâs healthy, which should serve as a reminder of what this season is for. Young was always going to have to grow through some of these travails before he realistically could find his groove and thrive. But the question is: Can his offensive line give him a chance? The penalties and run blocking were both poor on Sunday, and the group has struggled all season. On top of that, the defense is really banged up."
2023,4,31,Denver Broncos,0-3,"Itâs hard to know where to start. Denver has lost games by one , two and 50 points . The talk has now temporarily shifted from the Sean Payton- Russell Wilson relationship to whatever in the world is happening with the defense. In Week 1, that unit played well enough to win. In Week 2, Sam Howell carved Denver up. Week 3 was just an ambush, the likes of which weâve not seen in many, many years. Would you believe that the Broncos have the sixth-most-expensive defense in the NFL, per Over the Cap ? Wilson and the passing game have done some nice things, but not nice enough to overcome that. The defense needs to straighten out fast."
2023,4,32,Chicago Bears,0-3,"There have been better weeks in franchise history. Justin Fields seemed to throw the coaching staff under the bus before clarifying that he wasnât blaming anything on the coaches, and then he struggled to get loose again in Sundayâs 31-point loss . The defense, now run by head coach Matt Eberflus after Alan Williams resigned , was even worse. The good news is that in Week 4 the Bears face another 0-3 team, one that lost by a bigger margin on Sunday . But if the Bears fall to the Broncos this Sunday , it will be hard to blame fans if they want to start thinking about going into hibernation until draft season."
2023,5,1,San Francisco 49ers,4-0,"I touched on this right after Sunday's 35-16 win over Arizona, but I think itâs worth repeating: Brandon Aiyuk has become such a dangerous element for this offense. Yes, yes, Christian McCaffrey scored four TDs -- heâs amazing and all of that. But Aiyukâs speed spreads the defense wide and deep, and opponents still have to worry about CMC, George Kittle and Deebo Samuel . Aiyuk came back from injury on Sunday and had catches of 16, 11, 42, 25, 34 and 20 yards -- the first five coming on first downs . So right when youâre gearing up for a handoff, Kyle Shanahan will call a shot play to Aiyuk. Thatâs just wicked. Kittle and Deebo combined for one catch, but the offense mostly hummed right along. And after things tightened up in the third quarter, San Francisco ultimately won comfortably."
2023,5,2,Kansas City Chiefs,3-1,"Patrick Mahomes had one of the stranger outings of his career in a 23-20 victory over the Jets , perhaps switching bodies with Zach Wilson for the middle part of the Sunday night tilt. I didnât expect Mahomes to go full Mamba and unleash the legs quite that much, but thatâs what he does on off nights. And itâs a big part of what makes him the best. Pat can beat you -- on the road, in the fourth quarter -- with his fourth-best pitch. Kansas Cityâs defense was humbled a bit after a really strong start to the season, but all told, the Chiefs survived a scare in prime time. Now three wins removed from the Kickoff Game loss to the Lions, the Chiefs are getting their mojo back -- while acquiring a whole new legion of fans ."
2023,5,3,Buffalo Bills,3-1,"The Bills turned an early shootout against the Dolphins into a boat race. The four-touchdown margin of victory was yet another reminder that when the Bills are on, they are as tough to stop as anyone out there. When the defense faltered early, the offense picked up the slack -- to the point where it wasnât clear whether Josh Allen or Tua Tagovailoa operated the most explosive group. By the end of the statement victory over Miami, it was fair to say Buffalo's defense had turned in an excellent effort. Thatâs how good teams are built, knowing the heavy lifting wonât always be evenly split. That Week 1 loss to the Jets suddenly feels like a distant memory, and over the next seven weeks, the Bills face one team that currently owns a winning record (Tampa Bay in Week 8) . Could this team be 10-1 when it visits Philadelphia in Week 12 ?"
2023,5,4,Philadelphia Eagles,4-0,"The Eagles like to make things harder on themselves than needed, yet they keep winning, even if it took overtime vs. Washington on Sunday. The offense is returning to shades of 2022 form, adding the DâAndre Swift dimension and rekindling the Jalen Hurts-to-A.J. Brown magic . But self-inflicted errors almost cost Philadelphia the game. Among the teeth-gnashing penalties: Zach Cunningham âs defensive hold wiping out a stop; two bad personal fouls on Terrell Edmunds ; James Bradberry âs DPI; Brownâs post-TD taunting flag; even Hurtsâ intentional grounding briefly knocked Philly out of field-goal range in OT. This team has elite talent, but you canât be that fast and loose every week. Did you know the Eagles have allowed more TDs than theyâve scored?"
2023,5,5,Dallas Cowboys,3-1,"Will Week 3's head-scratching loss at Arizona end up being an aberration? One bounce-back win doesn't prove anything, but Dallas thoroughly demolished Bill Belichick and the Patriots in all phases. Even when the Cowboys slightly let their foot off the gas, they were head-and-shoulders better. Thatâs reassuring. DaRon Blandâs pick-six was such an important play in the game (after he missed a chance at one earlier) because it effectively ended the Patriotsâ chances before halftime and sent a message that this defense can indeed soldier on without Trevon Diggs . Plus, even with some OL breakdowns, the offense proved to be efficient and occasionally dangerous against a good Pats defense."
2023,5,6,Miami Dolphins,3-1,"A week after starting center Connor Williams (groin) was sidelined by injury, Miami lost Pro Bowl left tackle Terron Armstead (knee), and the Dolphins finally found themselves in a street race they couldn't win, ultimately taking their first defeat by the humbling final tally of 48-20 . The offensive harmony of the first three games fizzled out amid steady Buffalo pressure and a unit pressing too much down multiple scores. Scoring points wonât be problematic most games. The Dolphins also wonât face Bills-caliber teams every week. But they badly must find ways to beat their AFC East rivals, having now lost 10 of the past 11 in the series, with no wins in Buffalo for seven years. Miami almost feels like that pre-dynasty squad that can beat almost any team out there, but not yet the one it needs to beat the most."
2023,5,7,Detroit Lions,3-1,"Itâs a new era in Motown. The Lions smashed the Packers at Lambeau Field last Thursday, then found out Friday that 2022 first-rounder Jameson Williams would be returning early from suspension . They officially became division favorites before the Williams news, and theyâre potentially adding exactly what they need in the speedy wide receiver. But Williams also returns with much to prove, given his lofty draft status, limited production and a nagging penchant for being unavailable. One thing to remember: He suffered a hamstring injury in August , played only preseason game and couldnât communicate with the team during the first three weeks of his suspension, so expectations must be adjusted. But now the runway for him to be reacclimated is longer -- and begins right when Detroit embarks on a reasonable slice of the schedule, even with competitive road games at Tampa and Baltimore on tap this month."
2023,5,8,Baltimore Ravens,3-1,"Donât forget these guys. With a 3-1 record that includes two big divisional road wins , the Ravens are in great shape again following the shocking home loss to Indianapolis . The Ravens werenât about to let another backup QB beat them, with the Roquan Smith -led defense taking the wheel against the Deshaun Watson -less Browns. That unit allowed 166 yards on 65 plays, made 10 tackles for losses and forced three turnovers, absolutely stifling a Cleveland team that was supposed to have the league's best defense itself. Lamar Jackson and Co. were efficient against that good Browns D, and believe it or not, Jackson logged his first career game with multiple TD passes and runs. But the biggest offensive development was the reintroduction of tight end Mark Andrews (5/80/2) as the go-to guy after a slow start to the season."
2023,5,9,Seattle Seahawks,3-1,"This probably wasn't how Geno Smith and Jamal Adams envisioned their New York homecomings. Adams, the former Jet, was making his presence felt early but left with a concussion after nine snaps. Smith, the former Jet and Giant, left with a knee injury in the second quarter but returned after halftime to help finish off the win , albeit in an uneven second half. Drew Lock made a few plays in relief, leading the offense on a TD drive. It's not often a team can win on the road using four different battery combinations (two QBs and two centers), but that's what happened. It's easier when your defense can rack up 11 sacks, a 97-yard pick-six , another INT and a fumble recovery taken inside the opponent's 10-yard line. It wasn't pretty, but it was a gutsy win."
2023,5,10,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-1,"The Bucs were more aggressive offensively in their win over the Saints , with Baker Mayfield providing some good (first-down passes downfield, scrambling for first downs) and some bad ( a goal-line pick ). The run game remains a work in progress, but the overall results were positive, given Tampa was without the injured Mike Evans for much of the day. Defensively, the Bucs swarmed Alvin Kamara (24 touches, 84 yards), got to Derek Carr enough and caused two turnovers. A big forced fumble from Antoine Winfield Jr. set up Trey Palmer 's touchdown , bailing out Mayfield just before halftime. Great team ball. Winfield also batted away a would-be TD to Chris Olave . The Bucs' 11 penalties were rough -- those were part of the reason they didn't put the Saints away sooner."
2023,5,11,Cleveland Browns,2-2,"Itâs hard to put too much stock into a team losing with a backup QB getting his first real NFL action, but that doesnât negate the fact that Cleveland was flattened by Baltimore at home, as even the Brownsâ vaunted defense couldnât stop the runaway train. The Ravens led 14-3 four minutes before halftime, and the game essentially was over. Could Deshaun Watson have done anything to change the result? Thatâs a tough question. He played well in Week 3 , but before that? Meh. The funny thing is that the Browns clearly need Watson to win, but his play is also often ripe for deserved criticism. That cloaks the entire operation while Cleveland tries to regroup on bye and gear up for hosting the 49ers in Week 6."
2023,5,12,Jacksonville Jaguars,2-2,"The Jaguars might have sleepwalked through September, but the London performance was more on the level of what we expected coming into the season. The offense was efficient, if unsexy, against a solid Atlanta defense. Trevor Lawrence played one of his cleaner games this season, and the offensive line was not a net negative. Youâd like to see Jacksonville convert in the red zone, but that was a winning performance on offense. It was even better on defense, which only really bent on the Falconsâ third quarter TD drive. The secondary stood tall, and Josh Allen is suddenly having one of his best seasons to date. Every AFC South team stands at 2-2. The Jaguars might be lucky their slow start didnât hinder them more."
2023,5,13,Los Angeles Chargers,2-2,"The win over the Raiders was arguably the Chargers' most complete performance, even if it came down to a wild sequence of events and included a failed fourth-and-short conversion attempt late in the game in their own territory. Points for creativity, boys. It's also interesting that the defense has allowed fewer points with each game (although the Vikings did rack up 475 yards on them in Week 3 ). Khalil Mack did a lot of the damage , working against a rookie QB in his first start, but it's progress nonetheless. Sunday was also arguably the Chargers' worst offensive performance, with Justin Herbert 's finger injury surely playing a part. After a couple epic losses , the Chargers have settled in comfortably entering their Week 5 bye."
2023,5,14,Green Bay Packers,2-2,"Matt LaFleur all but questioned the Packersâ toughness after last Thursday's home loss to the Lions . The offensive and defensive lines both got whipped. It has been a roller-coaster ride in Jordan Love 's first four games as The Guy. Meanwhile, LaFleur got Aaron Jones back ... and then barely used the star back. It was such a disheartening loss -- not just because of how it happened, of course, but also against whom it came. The Packers have now fallen behind the Lions in the NFC North race and will need to fix a lot of things during a softer part of the schedule before the rematch in Detroit on Thanksgiving. The trench issue looms, but this offense can and will become a more dangerous group over the course of the season. Bank on it."
2023,5,15,Houston Texans,2-2,"Just like that, football fever is back in Houston, with two stunningly impressive wins following a pair of double-digit losses . DeMeco Ryans appears to have his team believing after the Texans' first home victory since 2021. And why not? Rookie CB C.J. Stroud looks poised -- making 151 straight throws without a pick to start his career -- and dangerous, despite multiple starters on the offensive line (most notably Laremy Tunsil ) being out. Houston controlled the clock with a stout run game and zero turnovers, freshening the defense to turn in its best performance of Ryans' early tenure. You'd like to see the Texans avoid getting bogged down so much offensively in and near the red zone, but it's hard to nitpick much after they beat Pittsburgh the way they did."
2023,5,16,Tennessee Titans,2-2,"An improved defensive performance and a resurgent Derrick Henry were exactly what the Titans needed to pull to .500 in a statement victory over the Bengals. It helped that Joe Burrow limped into the game and Tee Higgins left early, but the Titans overwhelmed Cincinnati on both lines of scrimmage and thoroughly dominated. Tennessee got away with three fumbles (recovering all of them) and a meaningless late pick from Ryan Tannehill , and there were a few miscues in pass protection, so there's plenty to work on. But the Henry- Tyjae Spears backfield looks very promising again, and the AFC South remains wide open. Mike Vrabel can win with this group."
2023,5,17,Los Angeles Rams,2-2,"Early on against the Colts , the Rams really leaned on them with the run game -- not for many chunk plays, but for consistent short and medium pickups. I suspect that took a physical toll on Indianapolis and factored into the Colts coming up just short in their comeback attempt. Basically, this is my way to avoid focusing on Puka Nacua for the fourth straight week, but I really like that Sean McVay has added a power-running dimension to his team that it seldom had before. But yeah, Nacua remains a revelation , and Cooper Kupp is coming back . As long as Matthew Stafford remains upright, this is a dangerous and intriguing team."
2023,5,18,New Orleans Saints,2-2,"Thatâs now seven straight games where the offense has scored 20 or fewer points. This one comes with an asterisk in that it involved Derek Carr playing at less than full strength. Carr missed some throws, for sure, but how many came as a result of his sore shoulder ? That's hard to tell. The Saints were struggling offensively before Carr got hurt. The defense is pretty terrific, but how long can it hold teams down without some help? The Saints have only five touchdowns in four games; only one team, Cincinnati with four, has fewer. One of those TDs was a Rashid Shaheed punt return , so theyâre averaging one offensive touchdown per game. Somehow, some way, it must be fixed."
2023,5,19,New York Jets,1-3,"By the end of the disappointing loss on Sunday night , the Jets looked fighting mad that theyâd let a golden opportunity slip through their fingers. Zach Wilson played some of the best football of his pro career for a minute and was far more good than bad overall. The defense picked off Patrick Mahomes two times. The offensive attack was diverse and aggressive. But in the end, there were too many loose ends. The missed field goal on fourth-and-1. The controversial flag on Sauce Gardner . Wilsonâs fumble, followed by Mahomes playing keep-away. This team can still have a decent season, but itâs also at risk of running off the rails at 1-3."
2023,5,20,Cincinnati Bengals,1-3,"Youâre free to be worried now. I am. We were anesthetized to believe that middling home showings in Weeks 2 and 3 were evidence this team was pulling out of its slump, which led to me putting them at -- gulp! -- No. 11 last week. But no, things arenât good, not after a beatdown from a Titans team that looked rather ordinary previously. Sunday brought everything back to the starting line -- and at 1-3, Cincy actually has given every division rival at least a one-game head start. Do you currently trust any element of this Bengals operation, including and starting with a beat-up Joe Burrow ? The 2022 Bengals averaged almost three TDs per game. This year, they have three offensive TDs in four games."
2023,5,21,Atlanta Falcons,2-2,"The goodwill stockpiled after a 2-0 start has diminished as the offense has gone cold. Desmond Ridder âs ball security and accuracy are concerns. Drake London doesnât get the ball until the Falcons are trailing. Kyle Pitts hardly ever gets the ball. The leagueâs fourth-most expensive offensive line, per Over the Cap , has been whipped repeatedly by good pass rushes. Bijan Robinson is the one consistent producer, and it often requires him to do something special to make chunk plays. The whole offensive operation needs a post-London scrubbing, from top to bottom. Right now, Atlanta is asking too much from a respectable defense to make up for the offensive shortcomings."
2023,5,22,Washington Commanders,2-2,"The theme here should be resiliency. We saw Sam Howell take his lumps -- big ones -- in the nine-sack, four-pick outing in Week 3 , but he came back on Sunday and was great, albeit in an overtime loss to the Eagles . Howell got the Commanders out to a strong start and then rallied them back with two clutch fourth-quarter TD drives. Iâm just as hopeful that CB Emmanuel Forbes can have a similar rebirth, because Sunday was a rough one for the rookie. The Eagles went after Forbes right away and didnât stop. Forbes allowed197 yards on nine catches, including the double-move 28-yard TD by A.J. Brown , per Next Gen Stats. Those were tough assignments, and I still believe in the intriguing first-round pick -- and the overall fight of this team."
2023,5,23,Pittsburgh Steelers,2-2,"Dyed-in-the-wool Steelers fans have heard statements from Mike Tomlin similar to the pledge -- "" Hell yeah, there's gonna be changes "" --  he offered after getting blown out by Houston . The questions are what will change, and how? There will likely be a temptation to start their top two 2023 draft picks and replace Najee Harris with Jaylen Warren ; might they even make a change at offensive coordinator? These are all well-worn themes among observers in Steeltown by now. The injury Kenny Pickett suffered Sunday isn't considered serious , but the Steelers should at least consider sitting him Sunday against the Ravens if he's not fairly healthy. Even when Cam Heyward and Diontae Johnson return from injury, they won't be able to fix the whole ship by themselves."
2023,5,24,New England Patriots,1-3,"Just when it looked like Mac Jones was trending in the right direction, he endured a nightmare at Dallas . Whether it was carrying the ball at his side or throwing multiple times against the grain , Jones was just way too casual with ball security. He looked rattled in the face of adversity. This was everything Jones was sold as not being coming out of Alabama, but itâs become his NFL hallmark. Right now, heâs trying to do more than his capacities allow for a Patriots offense riddled with shortcomings. No obvious playmakers. No bedrock offensive line. A run game with a defined ceiling. The offensive issues are snowballing before the weather turns cold in New England."
2023,5,25,Minnesota Vikings,1-3,"This team is still learning how to turn in a complete performance, but a win is a win . Kirk Cousins had his worst outing of the season, throwing two picks, both in the red zone, including a 99-yard pick-six . But the run game woke up and the defense made enough plays. Harrison Smith had a great day, recording three sacks, including the game-clincher , and his forced fumble was run back by D.J. Wonnum for the go-ahead touchdown . Wonnum was everywhere, too, with a sack and a near pick-six. After falling behind 10-0 early, the Vikings notched a hard-fought road victory. Baby steps."
2023,5,26,Indianapolis Colts,2-2,"Colts fans really let me have it last week, some of them making excellent points against my ""unfair"" ranking of this team at No. 28 . I trusted my eyes watching them, and felt the Week 3 shocker at Baltimore came with fortunate turns. Through one half of Sunday's overtime loss to the Rams, I felt a little smug. Then the scrappy Colts threatened to make me devour my words. Anthony Richardson looked like a capital-P Playmaker in the second half. Zack Moss ran hard. The defense -- especially Dayo Odeyingbo -- suddenly was great. And how about Andrew Ogletree ! The grit isn't lacking, and the roster isn't bad. But most weeks, Indianapolis won't be able to fall behind 23-0, fail to get Michael Pittman Jr. involved until late, and still expect to compete."
2023,5,27,Arizona Cardinals,1-3,"There's a lot of fight and creativity in this team, but the defense has now been pushed around a little for three straight weeks. The clutch stops in the Week 3 win over Dallas might have masked some of the issues that were impossible to ignore against San Francisco in Week 4 . The Cardinals' game plan seemed smart: trying to shorten the game and take whatever risks presented themselves. But when the defense allows five TDs in six possessions (not counting the pre-halftime kneeldown), it ends up being futile in the end. The run defense was shoddy, the pressure was nonexistent ( except for Dennis Gardeck , who needs to play more) and the coverage wasn't great. This defense needs to rediscover its Week 1 form badly."
2023,5,28,Denver Broncos,1-3,"Overcoming a 21-point deficit deserves serious credit, even if the rally came against a Bears team mired in a 14-game losing streak. It might not be perfect, but Russell Wilson is playing some strong ball. Ten different Denver players caught passes Sunday, and some young guns -- Marvin Mims and Jaleel McLaughlin -- are stating cases for expanded roles. The defense allowed 112 points in an eight-quarter span from halftime of Week 2 to halftime Sunday, but it gummed up late and forced two game-sealing turnovers in the final seven minutes in Chicago. Maybe it's a start. It had better be. Three of the Broncos' next four games are at home, but in that span, they'll face presumably angry Jets and Packers teams and the Chiefs twice."
2023,5,29,Las Vegas Raiders,1-3,"Jimmy Garoppolo gives the Raiders the best chance to win, but Aidan O'Connell -- even with some rough moments -- should get another shot if Garoppolo can't go again in Week 5. O'Connell needs to speed up his clock considerably, and his three turnovers in Sunday's loss to the Chargers were killers. Two lost fumbles led to 14 L.A. points, and Las Vegas didn't get the ball back after the late-game pick . But O'Connell wasn't lost out there, either; he made a few big throws , more than I think Brian Hoyer would give them. Given Garoppolo's injury history, the kid needs to be ready. The Raiders aren't great, but they are fairly competitive."
2023,5,30,New York Giants,1-3,"Throwing the ball has become laborious. Handing it off without Saquon Barkley doesn't do much. So the Giants' offense has become overly reliant on Daniel Jones making something happen with his legs. He laid everything out there as the Giants clung to hope against the Seahawks , driving to the Seattle 5-yard line while down 14-3. That's when Jones threw a back-breaking pick-six , followed by apparent tension between Jones and Brian Daboll on the sideline. The hell-on-wheels defense did all it could to hold the Seahawks down, minus a few busted plays. But Jones was sacked 10 times and fumbled twice, and it's hard to imagine the other units compensating for that. This offense is just in dire shape right now."
2023,5,31,Carolina Panthers,0-4,"I had to check the stats twice. The Panthers possessed the ball for 38:29 against the Vikings , gaining 20 first downs. Yet they only totaled 232 yards (on 68 plays!) and didn't score an offensive touchdown. The defense battled all game, but a familiar script keeps playing out. Bryce Young nipped away but couldn't finish drives and once again coughed up a critical turnover that led to points for the other side. When you look at Carolina's schedule , it's hard to see where the first victory will come. If the Panthers can keep it close in the next two road games ( at Detroit , at Miami ) before the Week 7 bye, it will be an encouraging development."
2023,5,32,Chicago Bears,0-4,"While I was sharpening my sardonic swords for whomever (the Bears or Broncos) ended up in this space, delivering any Bears barbs now would feel like piling on during what's become a nightmare season. Blowing a 21-point lead to Denver hurts, but the suffering is becoming numbing. Unless you're Matt Eberflus, who is feeling heat while presiding over a franchise-record losing streak. If there was a silver lining, it was that Justin Fields really had the kind of game (335 yards and four TDs passing) everyone in Chicago was hoping for this season, save for the two late turnovers. DJ Moore logging his best effort of the season helped, but it came on a day the Bears told fellow WR Chase Claypool to stay home . And they lost to a Broncos defense that has been steamrolled by others. But at least Fields showed something."
2023,6,1,San Francisco 49ers,5-0,"If there were Brock Purdy doubters still lingering, Sunday night should have muzzled those folks a bit. The 49ers are just clicking right now offensively, and as long as Purdy has a healthy Four Horsemen -- CMC , Brandon Aiyuk , George Kittle and Deebo Samuel -- it's going to be lights out against most defenses. Kyle Shanahan seemed to be having a blast, emptying the bag against a highly touted Dallas defense. But it's also time to trumpet the achievements of San Francisco's D, which hasn't missed too many beats since DeMeco Ryans left the coordinator post. The Niners lead the league in turnover differential (+7, tied with Tampa Bay) and points allowed per game (13.6). They might not be unbeatable, but it's going to take a pretty strong effort to get them right now."
2023,6,2,Philadelphia Eagles,5-0,"The Eagles are a delightfully imperfect team at a perfect 5-0 after beating the Rams . It's not always remarkably pretty, at least not by the standard set by the 2022 Eagles, but that's starting to not matter much. You can rue the lack of red-zone execution or whatever issue du jour might come up on any game day if you want. When Nick Sirianni has proven he'll take almost any worthy chance presented to him, it can compensate for a lot. What kind of a team takes the ball 32 seconds before halftime at its own 25-yard line expecting to score -- and then does , on a "" Brotherly shove, "" as the game clock expires? The same team that calls QB draw on third-and-9, fully knowing it will go for it on fourth down if needed. The schedule toughens considerably, though, so the execution can't remain lukewarm forever."
2023,6,3,Kansas City Chiefs,4-1,"Two third-quarter touchdown drives -- one with Travis Kelce , one without -- helped the Chiefs get out of Minnesota with a W , even though they struggled to put the game away. Kelce's heroics aside, that might be the kind of game Kansas City will have to master this season. Outside of the thrashing of the Bears in Week 3 , the other four games were one-score affairs that came down to a late possession. That's reminiscent of how the 2019 Chiefs won, battling through nine one-score games (with a 5-4 record) en route to their first Super Bowl title since 1969. They'd be fine going the blowout route instead, I am sure, and it could happen again soon, with two matchups upcoming vs. Denver . But learning to win hard-fought games in tough circumstances is never bad."
2023,6,4,Miami Dolphins,4-1,"This wasn't Tua Tagovailoa 's best outing, with his pick-six making it appear to be a much closer game than it really was. The Dolphins' supporting cast is so good, though, that they still beat the Giants comfortably . Tyreek Hill is on pace for 2,213 receiving yards, which is almost 250 yards more than Calvin Johnson's current single-season NFL record (1,964). That's great, but the news that De'Von Achane (seven TDs in four games) will miss multiple weeks with a knee injury stings. Thankfully, the defense came up with the kind of performance on Sunday that should boost its confidence, even taking into account the star-crossed nature of the Giants' offense. Vic Fangio's bunch needed that after being worked over in Week 4 by the Bills. Miami gets a wounded Panthers team in Week 6 . Then the fun really starts before the Week 10 bye: at the Eagles in Week 7 , vs. the Patriots in Week 8 and at the Chiefs in Week 9 ."
2023,6,5,Detroit Lions,4-1,"The Lions dropped 42 on the Panthers without Amon-Ra St. Brown or Jahmyr Gibbs (and others), which only enhances what they've accomplished through Week 5. Even though it came against winless Carolina, this victory shouldn't be overlooked. Good teams take care of business against lesser teams. Doing so convincingly despite the absence of key contributors on both sides of the ball is the hallmark of a great team. It's OK to say it aloud -- the Lions are now in that category. They've won 12 of 15 games dating back to 2022, triumphing at Arrowhead and Lambeau this season and becoming the clear-cut NFC North faves. Even with defensive injuries mounting -- poor Emmanuel Moseley is the latest, having suffered a second torn ACL in as many years -- the Lions have a great chance to end a 32-year playoff-win drought."
2023,6,6,Buffalo Bills,3-2,"I'm willing to buy a little into the notion that waiting to fly to London until Friday made it tough for the Bills to adjust to the time difference. The offense that scored 30-plus points in three straight weeks was lagging until a pair of too-little-too-late fourth-quarter TD drives. Falling like that and sustaining more injuries on defense ( Matt Milano and DaQuan Jones were both lost ) made this one a double gut punch. With Tre'Davious White going down the week prior, this good defense is in tough shape, even with Von Miller returning on Sunday. Getting Greg Rousseau back eventually should boost the pass rush, but the big plays allowed in coverage were troubling. I still have the Bills ahead of the Jaguars, despite the loss. Why? Because the Bills have the stronger body of work overall and could be favored in a playoff rematch, even in Jacksonville"
2023,6,7,Jacksonville Jaguars,3-2,"Even with Week 4âs solid, convincing victory over Atlanta , I think Sunday was the first time I could say the offense was really humming. This had been a bit of an underperforming unit, frankly, prior to ringing up 474 yards and 29 first downs against Buffalo , even with Trevor Lawrence âs three fumbles (two lost). And I'm not ignoring the fact that he and his team have fumbled at too high a rate, and the sacks keep racking up. But getting that big-play potency back was pretty key, and it was fueled by Calvin Ridley and Travis Etienne -- just as it was meant to be. The defense has been mostly stout, but the offense had to find a little mojo."
2023,6,8,Dallas Cowboys,3-2,"A rough loss to the Cardinals in Week 3 was followed by a laugher win against the Patriots in Week 4 , then a full-on tail-whipping from the 49ers . What do we make of this team after the past three weeks? Dak Prescott had an awful night on Sunday, as did Tony Pollard , who disappeared after his first-quarter fumble . Even the fallback defense was tarred and feathered, to the point where it's fair to challenge that unit's lofty reputation. The 49ers stood up to Dallas' toughness and pushed back -- several times into the end zone. The Cowboys face old friend Kellen Moore and the Chargers in prime time this coming Monday , and you can bet that Moore took close notes on what Kyle Shanahan achieved Sunday. Will Dallas bounce back? Or limp into the Week 7 bye at 3-3?"
2023,6,9,Seattle Seahawks,3-1,"The Seahawks floated into their Week 5 bye week with a rousing defensive performance against the Giants . If there was only one negative to racking up 11 sacks , it was that it overshadowed the improvements Seattle has made in run defense through four games. The Seahawks are allowing 1.7 yards per carry less than they did last season, when they were pushed around by opponents up front. If there's a concern in the 3-1 start, it's that they're not good enough on third downs -- on either side of the ball. But assuming Geno Smith is fine and the downfield passing game gets cooking again, the Seahawks should be in decent shape. And they don't face the vaunted 49ers until Weeks 12 and 14 , so there's time to get things in order."
2023,6,10,Baltimore Ravens,3-2,"Sunday's loss hurt more than the Week 3 stunner against the Colts did, in my opinion. Sure, falling to a backup QB isn't ideal, but Gardner Minshew is decent, as are the Colts; plus, that game was straight-up fluky in a lot of ways. Week 5? The Ravens just gave Pittsburgh the win. They had chances to step on the Steelers' necks multiple times throughout, but dropped passes, turnovers ( two by Lamar Jackson late) and special-teams breakdowns started the avalanche, with Pickett-to-Pickens finishing it. The Ravens are a good team. My suspicion is they'll snap out of whatever funk they're in and realize it. Maybe the trip to London will be cleansing. Or at least more cleansing than their last trip overseas ."
2023,6,11,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-1,"Although the Week 3 loss to the Eagles is a stark reminder of what the Bucs looked like against the one true contender they've faced to this point, it's hard not to take a step back and like most of what we've seen from this team. Todd Bowles has quietly done an excellent job on the whole, reshaping a strong, hard-nosed defense and entrusting the offense to QB Baker Mayfield and offensive coordinator Dave Canales. The run game might be pretty dormant, but the defense has kept scores down enough with incredible red-zone work to give Tampa Bay chances to win most games. Can this formula continue? We'll likely find out during this fatter part of the schedule, with the next three opponents ( vs. Lions , vs. Falcons , at Bills ) upping the stakes."
2023,6,12,Cleveland Browns,2-2,"Everything about Week 4 , from Deshaun Watson missing the game to the defense having its first real tough outing of the season, forced us to reevaluate this team on its Week 5 bye. San Francisco is coming to town Sunday, followed by road tests at Indianapolis and Seattle , and there are enough questions to wonder if this team is built to last. The lack of offensive consistency is the most pressing issue, and we just don't know if Watson and Kevin Stefanski have the magic formula. The Nick Chubb -less run game is a limiting factor right now, and there are concerns on the offensive line ( Jedrick Wills ' performance, a lack of depth). As good as the defense has been, it would behoove that unit to create more turnovers. This team needs all the possessions it can steal from opponents."
2023,6,13,Los Angeles Chargers,2-2,"The panic meter dropped after the team hit the bye at 2-2 with two straight victories. But reality sets in: The Chargers must play games in 13 straight weeks, and the remaining schedule includes the following foes: the Cowboys this coming Monday , the Chiefs in Week 7 (and Week 18 ), the Lions in Week 10 , the Ravens in Week 12 and the Bills in Week 16 . Close victories over the Vikings and Raiders donât inspire enough confidence that all is right in Chargerville heading into that stretch. The biggest worry is limiting explosive pass plays, and many of L.A.'s remaining opponents throw the ball pretty well. Thereâs a long road ahead."
2023,6,14,New Orleans Saints,3-2,"Well, that fixed the Saints' offensive problems, right? OK, so that might be a stretch, but it was good to see them stretch things out a bit early -- and for Derek Carr to hold up a week after he didn't look quite right -- against a supposedly quality Patriots defense. They went back to a more conservative approach after a while, but who can blame them? New England had basically given up by that point. When you have a defense capable of blanking (and frankly humiliating) an opponent in its home stadium, you can accept less-than-perfect play on the other side of the ball. This really was a good win , with myriad contributors on both sides."
2023,6,15,Cincinnati Bengals,2-3,"You knew eventually things would start clicking offensively for the Bengals. I thought Joe Burrow might be feeling healthier after watching the way he moved on the opening-drive TD pass against Arizona . I was sure of it when he scrambled for 10 yards late in the third quarter. That was a huge development, as was Burrow continually feeding his guy , Ja'Marr Chase , with success. The defense did enough to get by, but this was no get-right outing for that unit, despite logging two INTs ( one a pick-six ) and three sacks. The tackling and run fits were kind of gross, which has become a bit of a chronic issue lately. The bigger test is this Sunday against Seattle, which loves to pound the ball. If the Bengals can withstand the Seahawks' rush and have another big day throwing it, they might still be in this thing."
2023,6,16,Atlanta Falcons,3-2,"Desmond Ridder delivered the performance on Sunday that some critics said he couldn't, which was a huge development for this team. He made several big throws, but none were bigger than the 23-yarder to Drake London with under a minute remaining -- after a low snap, and with pressure in Ridder's face. From there, the Falcons just had to drain the clock and turn it over to their kicker . This game checked a lot of boxes, with Ridder, London, Kyle Pitts , Bijan Robinson and Atlanta's underrated defense playing big roles in the victory. We'd still love for the Falcons to score more points, but they are 3-2, and aside from Tampa in Week 7 , none of their opponents before their Week 11 bye are currently above .500. Atlanta is back in good shape to contend for the NFC South crown."
2023,6,17,Indianapolis Colts,3-2,"On the one hand, things are very much looking up. The Colts have logged three wins in four games, and Jonathan Taylor is back with a big new contract . On the other hand, Anthony Richardson 's early-career injuries are reaching a concerning level. It's nice to have perhaps the NFL's best backup QB in Gardner Minshew , who has indeed been the ideal reliever. But Richardson has now suffered three different injuries in a four-game span, and the AC joint sprain in his right shoulder is expected to cost him a month-plus. It's a catch-22: Richardson's running might be his most dangerous quality, but the more he runs, the more he's exposed to injury. If the Colts can keep pace over the next five games, they'll still be in decent shape to contend for the AFC South title. Shane Steichen deserves early Coach of the Year sentiment for what he's done so far."
2023,6,18,Green Bay Packers,2-3,"Even after the slow start offensively, including a bad Jordan Love interception , it still felt like the Packers had every shot to win the game. Because they did. And the second-half script started out perfectly: First, the pretty pick by Rudy Ford ; then the AJ Dillon drive, where the 247-pound back just willed the Packers into the end zone . The defense hung tough, even if it did allow the go-ahead touchdown drive . But Love really struggled to connect with his receivers most of the night and finished with three back-breaking interceptions. The most concerning part: The ball never really came close to reaching Love's intended target on any of the three picks; they were just poor decisions and/or throws. The execution has to sharpen."
2023,6,19,New York Jets,2-3,"The Jets took the pitch count off of Breece Hall , and boom: He ran for a career-high 177 yards and looked incredible in the open field against Denver . The defense was a little hot and cold, but almost everything after halftime was terrific. That unit has the potential to be more consistently dominant, and statements like the late scoop-and-score can help elevate the swagger. Zach Wilson does a lot of little things well, sometimes very well. But two mistakes in high-leverage situations cost the Jets points against the Broncos, as did the other red-zone breakdowns. It wasnât a discouraging performance, but New York must find ways to get Garrett Wilson more involved. Hall and peak Garrett Wilson make the Jets dangerous."
2023,6,20,Pittsburgh Steelers,3-2,"I canât spare the details of how the Steelers actually arrived at 3-2, with some wild swings of play -- and, you know, a -31 point differential. You have to admire the teamâs toughness and creativity, finding inventive ways to win games. But I donât imagine that this bye week will include a getaway to Cabo. My guess is Pittsburgh knows thereâs a lot of work to be done. Nine days ago, Mike Tomlin was talking about big changes . Yet here they are, atop the AFC North -- for now."
2023,6,21,Houston Texans,2-3,"The Texans did almost everything right against the Falcons , winning the turnover battle (2-0) and committing fewer penalties (7-5), with C.J. Stroud leading a rousing TD drive to take the lead with less than two minutes left on the road. That Stroud has begun his pro career throwing an NFL-record 186 straight passes without an INT and hasn't taken a sack since Week 2 is frankly incredible. If you want to gripe about Houston's defense giving up the game-winning drive, I won't blame you. But given the high level Stroud is playing at, it was disappointing the offense couldn't muster better than 4-for-13 on third downs or 1-for-3 on red-zone possessions. Maybe DeMeco Ryans is regretting kicking a field goal early on fourth-and-1. Either way, this team is farther along than I imagined it would be."
2023,6,22,Los Angeles Rams,2-3,"Perhaps we allowed the Rams' surprisingly strong performances in Weeks 1 and 2 to color our view of their potential, but they've been somewhat of a disappointment in recent games, despite an OT road win and two close losses to teams that entered the season as legit Super Bowl contenders. It feels like Los Angeles has not put together a complete game since Week 1, even with spurts of good football. Matthew Stafford has battled, the receiving corps looks to be in great shape and the defense routinely keeps opponents' scores under control. So why can't the Rams finish more drives and win more of these close games?"
2023,6,23,Tennessee Titans,2-3,"The Titans' seesaw season continued with another road loss following Week 4's home victory ; they're now 0-3 outside Nashville. If there was a shocking takeaway from Sunday, it was that Indianapolis bullied Tennessee and kind of beat Mike Vrabel at his own game. Losing both lines of scrimmage while also losing the turnover battle and going 1-for-4 in the red zone is a tried-and-true path to defeat. I'd argue it was less stunning that Derrick Henry and the ground game stalled; we've seen that happen before. But what about the Titans' vaunted run defense? It was steamrolled by the Colts, who almost netted more rushing yards (193) in this game than Tennessee allowed in the previous three games combined (211)."
2023,6,24,Las Vegas Raiders,2-3,"Jimmy Garoppolo 's struggles threatened to give the game away, but the defense stood as tall as it has in a while -- and it wasn't all Maxx Crosby , even though he was exceptional, per usual. Big plays also came from some off-the-radar suspects. The Raiders had one interception on the season entering Week 5. Robert Spillane had one in his career before Monday. So it figures that Big Game Bob snagged two Jordan Love passes , even if those only led to three Raiders points. Amik Robertson's end-zone pick in the final minute finished it off, with just enough help from the offense in key spots. Garoppolo's nightmarish third quarter will haunt me until next week, but the Raiders found a way to get it done."
2023,6,25,Minnesota Vikings,1-4,"Theyâve lost eight fumbles and allowed every single opponent theyâve faced to score first, which at least partially explains how theyâre sitting at 1-4. So, do we take any solace from the fact that they were competitive against the Chiefs ? Itâs very hard to when Justin Jefferson had a tough game and left with a hamstring injury, and itâs even harder when the script plays out similarly to previous losses. A fumble on the first scrimmage play of the game , which no doubt was a point of emphasis all week in practice from Kevin OâConnell and his staff. ... Clock and game management errors. ... Offensive and defensive failures at key moments in a winnable game. Thatâs a lot to clean up before facing the Bears on the road. And now the Vikings must move forward without their best player for at least the next four contests, as Jefferson is hitting injured reserve ."
2023,6,26,Washington Commanders,2-3,"Winnable games lie ahead, but there are some really concerning trends that must end before harboring those thoughts. The high-profile defense is being gashed by big plays. Sam Howell is taking way too many hits. And the rookie class has provided little help, with first-round CB Emmanuel Forbes Jr. suffering through another tough outing last week. Arguably the most fixable of the issues is the defensive front. Dominating more and playing with more discipline on the D-line would help alleviate the secondary concerns. The Commanders' celebrated group of QB hunters is racking up pressures and sacks, but it hasn't taken over games enough. That unit is at least part of why Washingtonâs defense has taken a step backward."
2023,6,27,Arizona Cardinals,1-4,"This was a tough loss to swallow, because you knew the Cardinals were getting a vulnerable Bengals team at a pretty good time. But Joshua Dobbs had his first really rough day of the season, and the defense allowed a Tee Higgins -less offense to continue to hammer the same play over and over: Joe Burrow to Ja'Marr Chase . The secondary situation is a bit of a mess: Arizona was already down Budda Baker (on IR) and lost Jalen Thompson midway through the game. The Bengals picked on CBs Marco Wilson and Antonio Hamilton (who seems to have replaced rookie Kei'Trel Clark as a starter) repeatedly. Hamilton also got banged up Sunday, and it feels like the Cardinals are having to patch holes on the back end every week. Not to mention, bell-cow RB James Conner is expected to miss multiple weeks with a knee injury."
2023,6,28,Denver Broncos,1-4,"There were plenty of things worth pointing fingers at after the loss to the Jets , but it starts with Sean Payton. After all, Payton put the focus on himself with preseason comments that clearly played a role in fueling the Jets on Sunday. Was it arrogant? Meant to shield his players? Whatever it was, it has backfired tremendously in Paytonâs 1-4 start in Denver. That the Broncos reasonably could be 3-2 (and unreasonably, 4-1) is no solace when one loss came by 50 points . There have been too many self-inflicted errors to call this team a wolf in sheepâs clothing. The offense went ice cold most of the second half against New York, and the run defense was chewed up once more. Back to square one."
2023,6,29,New England Patriots,1-4,"The last two weeks have been the darkest stretch for this franchise in quite some time. Seeing Bill Belichick punt on fourth-and-3 from the Saintsâ 40-yard line in a 24-0 game in Foxborough was shocking. One of the greatest coaches in football history just seemed defeated. Two weeks in a row, the Patriots have had to bench Mac Jones for his own good. The season has gone from concerning to depressing, and I have very little hope that a banged-up defense is somehow going to come to the rescue. Until further notice, New England can safely be called one of the worst teams in the NFL, which is just strange to type. The fear factor is long gone."
2023,6,30,Chicago Bears,1-4,"Thursdayâs rousing victory was a bolt out the blue, but it did continue some of the offensive gains made in most of the loss to the Broncos , so thereâs evidence that things are developing on that side of the ball. Justin Fields now has enjoyed back-to-back banner games, and DJ Moore âs emergence gives Chicago a tangible strength. That said, the offensive line and backfield have issues, and the defense still needs to make strides, even after a mostly good performance at Washington. The good news is that the Bears have two straight home games against teams they can match up with ( Vikings and Raiders ) and they should get healthier in the secondary, with Eddie Jackson , Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon set to return at some point."
2023,6,31,New York Giants,1-4,"I feel badly for Joshua Ezeudu , who was apologizing for allowing a pummeling of his quarterback (again) on Sunday. Thereâs no way itâs on one guy, especially not a 2022 third-round pick playing out of position at left tackle. But thatâs the state of the Giantsâ offensive line now, with the entire group having been spun through the blender with injuries and ineffectiveness. And the sack Ezeudu surrendered -- one of seven allowed by New York on Sunday, after it gave up 11 in Week 4 -- did force Daniel Jones out with a neck injury. Injuries have ravaged the Giantsâ offense, and weâre only in Week 6. Quick, someone put Darren Waller in a bubble. This is awful."
2023,6,32,Carolina Panthers,0-5,"Anyone who took solace in the fact that the Panthers actually led in each of their first four losses was forced to admit after the fifth defeat that they were trying too hard. First, the bad news: This team isn't making the playoffs. No 0-5 team ever has, and Carolina gets the Dolphins in Miami this week . Now, the worse news: The Panthers don't own their first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, which would be the first overall pick at the moment, and the quarterback they traded that pick to draft this year, Bryce Young , is struggling. He's turned the ball over at least once in each of his four starts, has taken 12 sacks and is averaging 5.2 yards per attempt. The Panthers would surely like to see more from him -- and quickly."
2023,7,1,San Francisco 49ers,5-1,"Sunday's loss to the Browns was easily Brock Purdy 's worst game of the season, and his struggles shouldn't be glossed over, but I bet a lot of people ready to cut him down don't realize just how good Cleveland's defense is. Anyone who watched that game realized how tough a spot he was put in. Brandon Aiyuk dropped a would-be TD, the offense committed six penalties (12 total by San Francisco) and there were big injuries to Christian McCaffrey , Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams . Purdy also drove the 49ers to a spot where the game would have been won if not for Jake Moody 's errant field-goal attempt . The penalties are a big issue (the Niners lead the league with 45), but the most surprising development was seeing the Browns clearly winning the physical battle up front. San Francisco stays on top for now, given how the rest of the week played out in the NFL."
2023,7,2,Kansas City Chiefs,5-1,"The Chiefs have won five straight, but four of those contests were grinders, and the offense remains hamstrung a bit by middling red-zone production and too many turnovers. They would rather be in the position they are now than where they were in 2021, when the defense struggled early before getting back on track. Don't forget that that team opened the season at 3-4, yet still made the AFC Championship Game (and led 21-3 before ultimately falling to the Bengals ). The most concerning part about this team is its inability to slam the door shut. The Chiefs have only 12 fourth-quarter points this season -- all Harrison Butker field goals. There's no reason to freak out, but the lack of crunch-time production is out of character, and if it continues, it will come back to bite them against better opponents."
2023,7,3,Miami Dolphins,5-1,"Good teams are allowed hiccup games now and again, and Miami did win the final three quarters against Carolina on Sunday, 42-7. But there's a legitimate discussion about how we should judge this group, even as explosive as it is. Miami has beaten five opponents with a combined record of 5-24 to this point and was shellacked in Week 4 by the Bills, who currently sit at 4-2. That's the evidence we have as of now. We won't really see the big picture for the Dolphins until they've faced the Eagles ( in Week 7 ) and Chiefs ( in Week 9 ). Any team that features Tyreek Hill has a chance, and the reunion between Hill and his former K.C. compatriots in Germany will be must-see TV. But we've suddenly shifted to Jalen Ramsey Watch , having seen Eli Apple struggle at times again."
2023,7,4,Detroit Lions,5-1,"It feels like the Lions suffer a ""Wow, they can't afford to lose that guy"" type of injury every game or two. In the win over Tampa on Sunday , it was David Montgomery . With Jahmyr Gibbs already inactive, that meant Detroit went the distance with Craig Reynolds and Devine Ozigbo in the backfield. But the Lions just sort of figure out games like puzzles, and they're getting good at it. Jared Goff is such a trusted caretaker -- and playmaker -- at this point that Detroit was still able to forge three scoring drives after Montgomery left. And the defense! Aaron Glenn's group has been dealt a few tough injuries, but continues to deliver statement performances. My guess is the unit's effort on Sunday more than atoned for any irritation Dan Campbell felt over allowing two fourth-quarter touchdowns to the Panthers in Week 5 ."
2023,7,5,Philadelphia Eagles,5-1,"The defense really balled out, to the point that it was easy to forget the Eagles dropped the turnover battle in the loss to the Jets , 4-0. They had the ball late with the chance to seal a win, but Jalen Hurts threw his third interception of the game on what was just an awful mistake, setting up the decisive touchdown for New York. You can argue that the Eagles should have run the ball there, hanging on to a 14-12 lead inside the two-minute warning, with the Jets out of timeouts. But you can't argue Hurts made a good decision on that pick. His first INT should have been ruled a Dallas Goedert fumble, and Hurts' second INT came with pressure, as the injury that forced Lane Johnson to leave loomed large. Johnson's replacement, Jack Driscoll , became a turnstile for Jets pass rushers. Hurts did have decent moments, and A.J. Brown was terrific, but the rest of the offense stunk. DeVonta Smith 's two big drops were killers."
2023,7,6,Jacksonville Jaguars,4-2,"Don't look now, but the globetrotting Jags have stacked three straight impressive victories after opening the season 1-2. The most pressing immediate concern is obviously the knee injury to Trevor Lawrence , especially with a Thursday game at New Orleans looming. Even if Lawrence is OK, others could be absent for that one, given that Zay Jones and Walker Little missed Sunday with injuries, and Brandon Scherff and Tyson Campbell both left the win over the Colts with new maladies . The formula for victory has firmed up lately: take the ball away on defense and give it to Travis Etienne on offense. If that's enough for the Jags to pull off a short-week (and likely shorthanded) road win, we can fully bury Jacksonville's slow start to 2023."
2023,7,7,Buffalo Bills,4-2,"The Bills survived as the Giants cost themselves points at multiple key junctures Sunday night , one being the final play of the evening . I'll never kill teams that show guts and mental toughness and win without their ""A"" game. But, boy, Sean McDermott's decision to throw the ball on that third-and-9 late, resulting in an incompletion and, ultimately, the Giants getting the ball back, would have been a tough one to swallow had the Bills allowed 1 more yard at the end. Josh Allen made the circus TD throw to Quintin Morris , and it's plays like that that make us love him. But he also continues to appear frustrated having to play small ball so much, and that emotion seemed to boil over on Allen's ill-advised involvement -- with an injured shoulder -- in a third-quarter fracas with the Giants. This team sure likes to keep us guessing every few weeks."
2023,7,8,Dallas Cowboys,4-2,"After getting steamrolled by the 49ers , the Cowboys' defense ratcheted up its performance Monday night, particularly at winning time. Immediately after I typed ""Where is Micah?"" and ""Where are the big plays?"" in my notes, both questions were answered in style. Micah Parsons delivered a huge sack to put the Chargers on the ropes, then Stephon Gilmore provided the knockout blow with a pick on the very next play . Dak Prescott had some much-needed big moments in the win , and the Cowboys weathered a late storm -- another crucial test passed. Los Angeles controlled the third quarter, but Dallas responded with an impressive touchdown drive and a much-needed stop ... until the muffed punt that led to the Bolts' game-tying TD . That's when Prescott willed the 'Boys back, and ""Mr. Perfect"" Brandon Aubrey hit another big kick . Impressive resilience that'll make the bye week sweeter in Big D."
2023,7,9,Baltimore Ravens,4-2,"The Ravens were fortunate to get away with bogging down early in the red zone. On the surface, the offensive numbers were fine in the 24-16 win over Tennessee , with 360 yards (221 passing, 139 rushing), but Baltimore going 1-for-6 in red-zone conversions explains the close score. The Ravens ran 17 red-zone plays in London. Seven were Lamar Jackson runs. Seven were handoffs. Three were Jackson passes. Of Jackson's rushing attempts down there, only a few appeared to be designed runs; I'd like to see Lamar throwing more when close to the end zone. A win is a win, but after a 4-for-4 red-zone game at Cleveland , the Ravens have posted touchdowns on just two of their last nine trips to the red area."
2023,7,10,Cleveland Browns,3-2,"I caught some heat on social media for putting the Browns as high as No. 12 last week , and the more doubt that was cast on Deshaun Watson 's availability for Sunday, the more I started to think those critics might have been right. But Cleveland's defense turned in an incredible showing, nearly grinding the 49ers' offense to a halt, even if several San Francisco injuries were a factor in the Browns win . That defense now has staked its worthy claim as the best unit in the NFL, with PJ Walker doing enough in place of Watson against a 49ers team that's comparable to the Browns defensively. What a wild, weird season to date for Cleveland, ping-ponging back and forth between excellence and disaster."
2023,7,11,Seattle Seahawks,3-2,"Geno Smith fell on the sword after throwing a pair of picks in a narrow, frustrating loss at Cincinnati , but the tape revealed only one interception was truly, unquestionably his fault: the red-zone grab by Mike Hilton in the third quarter. The other can be blamed on DK Metcalf stopping his route. Bottom line: The Seahawks lost the game by scoring 10 points in five red-zone trips, and blame for that can be shared offense-wide. If there was a silver lining, it was that the defense put on a show from the second quarter on, stopping Joe Burrow and the Bengals cold after they mounted consecutive touchdown drives with their first two possessions. I'm not at all giving up on this Seattle team, but this L will stick in their craw for a minute."
2023,7,12,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-2,"Six points. No touchdowns. A lousy 2 of 12 on third downs. An interception inside their own 15-yard line. The Tampa Bay offense had its worst outing of the season in Sunday's 20-6 loss to Detroit, and yet it's hard to say that it was a shocking breakdown. Though Baker Mayfield struggled, we can't pin this game entirely on him. The run game has been a travesty this season, marred by poor performances by the O-line and backs. Todd Bowles punting on fourth-and-2 while down 14 points in the fourth quarter tells you everything you need to know. Yeah, the Lions' defense was terrific Sunday, but the decision to punt suggested Bowles had more faith in his defense causing a turnover than he did in his offense gaining 2 yards. That makes me worried for the long haul."
2023,7,13,Cincinnati Bengals,3-3,"The Bengals came out like gangbusters on their first two drives of Sunday's 17-13 win over the Seahawks, scoring touchdowns on both. Just like that, following a strong Week 5 showing , their offense had magically regenerated itself. Until it hadn't. Over the next eight drives, Cincinnati netted a feeble five first downs and 86 yards. The defense had to go into whatever-it-takes mode, especially as Seattle continually drove deep into Cincy territory. This D has enjoyed its share of red-zone heroics in recent years -- with critical plays from Germaine Pratt to Sam Hubbard to Vonn Bell and on -- and that group added some new contributors as it held Seattle to 10 points on five red-zone trips. Cincinnati might have limped to the bye at 3-3, but getting to this point at .500 is admirable."
2023,7,14,Los Angeles Chargers,2-3,"Having entered Monday night's game with a mangled finger on his non-throwing hand, Justin Herbert looked pretty unencumbered early but struggled at times late. Herbert missed a wide-open Keenan Allen twice on deep balls (one in each half), couldn't find Josh Palmer on a critical turnover on downs, nearly threw an interception with about nine minutes left and did throw a pick to essentially end the game. The 4th-and-1 incompletion to Palmer in the red zone and Bolts CB Michael Davis' whiffed tackle on Tony Pollard -- while other Los Angeles defenders stood nearby and watched -- were almost too on the nose for the Chargers, the way these plays have piled up this season. A few critical penalties (some wiping out big gains) really put it over the top, and breakdowns late on both sides cost L.A. yet another close game ."
2023,7,15,New York Jets,3-3,"They have earned rest this week after evening their record at 3-3. With three winnable games coming out of the bye -- âatâ Giants , vs. Chargers , at Raiders -- this team cannot be dismissed, especially with an Aaron Rodgers miracle return not yet ruled out. Few Jets games have been pretty, and points remain a premium. That said, when you can beat a Super Bowl-caliber team with starting CBs Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed out -- and pick off three passes in the process -- you may dispense artistic merit in such cases. The Jets are lucky their mistakes against the Eagles didnât sting more, and 1-for-4 in the red zone wonât often cut it. This win, however, like seeing Rodgers throwing passes pregame , reminds us that anything remains possible."
2023,7,16,Houston Texans,3-3,"Some of the more pleasant early developments against the Saints were a run game that showed life and the Texans winning up front. Devin Singletary gave Houstonâs ground game a boost and could take carries away from Dameon Pierce , which is something to watch. Both lines of scrimmage were won by Houston early, with the Texansâ defensive line dominating the Saints most of the game. After being worn out late against Atlanta , DeMeco Ryansâ defense stood tall even while letting the Saints move the ball throughout the second half. My prediction is that the Texans will enter the offseason as a popular darling -- but given the steady hand with which C.J. Stroud is leading this team, I might need to shorten my timeline."
2023,7,17,Los Angeles Rams,3-3,"The Rams called three run plays and dropped back 17 times in the first half on Sunday against Arizona. On the opening drive of the second half, Sean McVay flipped the script on its head -- he opened with eight straight called runs, with Kyren Williams and Ronnie Rivers sharing the load. The day belonged to Williams (who finished with a career-high 158 yards) and Cooper Kupp , who amassed most of his 148 receiving yards early on. That kind of night-and-day approach to the game plan might not work against every opponent, and the Rams haven't been able to play a lot of complete games offensively this season. There's plenty to clean up from this one, such as the third-down offense (they went 4-for-11 in conversions and took two of their three sacks on the money down), with a tough Steelers defense on tap in Week 7 . And unfortunately, Williams and Rivers both left Sunday's win with injuries ."
2023,7,18,New Orleans Saints,3-3,"The Saints appear incapable of having all three units play well, or evenly passably, in the same game. The offense was strong in Week 5 but highly inconsistent on Sunday . The defense was pushed around early by the Texans. NFC Special Teams Player of the Week Blake Grupe missed two big kicks in the loss. Whatever Saints fans might think of offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael Jr., there are only so many fancy play calls that can overcome an underachieving offensive line and an erratic Derek Carr . The Saints have scored 20 fourth-quarter points in six games. Ten of those were in a blowout of the Patriots. Zero came in two brutal losses on the road, at Green Bay and at Houston . This is a decidedly average team until further notice."
2023,7,19,Pittsburgh Steelers,3-2,"With no indication the Steelers are replacing play-caller Matt Canada or QB Kenny Pickett any time soon, they must find internal solutions to get the offense on track -- like, say, an anything-goes self-scouting mission during the Week 6 bye. No group needed that more than the offensive line. I thought Broderick Jones played well against Baltimore ; continued improvement would be huge. So would the interior getting better, and Chukwuma Okorafor cutting down on penalties. If they fix those problems, the Steelers might have an offense that can win games."
2023,7,20,Green Bay Packers,2-3,"The Packers have dug their own holes during their 2-3 start, with two road losses coming by a combined five points, and they can't afford to dig another one at Denver in Week 7 coming out of their bye. They must find ways to get going offensively earlier in games. In their three defeats, they've logged 16 first-half points -- and only six in the past two losses. Green Bay's last first-half TD in any game came in Week 2 at Atlanta , and the team has been outscored 69-26 in first halves this season. Jordan Love isn't alone in terms of sharing blame. But in Weeks 1 and 2, the quarterback committed zero turnovers, and he posted just one in Week 3. Over the past two games, he's thrown five picks. Without the defense playing lights out, that won't cut it."
2023,7,21,Indianapolis Colts,3-3,"In his first start following the news that Anthony Richardson will be out an extended period, Gardner Minshew turned the ball over four times in the loss to Jacksonville -- and it could have been even worse. This isnât what we expected from Minshew, given that he entered the game with zero turnovers on the season, but itâs a reminder that in his two starts for the Eagles last season, Minshew threw three picks and fumbled four times (losing one). Owner Jim Irsay told ESPN on Monday that Richardson is â probably â done for the season, so itâs likely to be Minshew from here on out. The Jonathan Taylor - Zack Moss duo probably will take a bigger share of the load, but the Colts really are entering a tricky stretch facing back-to-back strong defenses in the Browns and Saints ."
2023,7,22,Atlanta Falcons,3-3,"Arthur Smith's decision to go for two after cutting Washington's lead to eight points early in the fourth quarter (the attempt failed) was not why the Falcons lost Sunday . Analytics folks have been screaming for years that going for two increases a team's chances of winning, and some coaches are finally listening. The real problem: Desmond Ridder followed up arguably the best game of his young career last week with arguably his worst -- against a Commanders defense that just had 40 hung on it by the Bears. Ridder's three picks ( especially the last one ) and two turnovers on downs did Atlanta in, raising questions about the quarterback and an offense that has failed to top 16 points in half the Falcons' games. The defense had five sacks and allowed fewer than 200 yards, but it wasn't enough."
2023,7,23,Las Vegas Raiders,3-3,"The defense has won two straight games for this team, which is a tremendous development, and the apparently positive news on the back injury Jimmy Garoppolo suffered in the win over New England keeps hope alive. If Garoppolo only ends up missing one game, the contest he misses will be against the Bears , who also have QB issues, with Justin Fields likely to be out for a spell . So that's another tremendous break. This team has been in every game save for Week 2 , when the Bills just outclassed the Raiders. Still, a group featuring Davante Adams and Josh Jacobs needs to score more than 19 offensive points in a game."
2023,7,24,Washington Commanders,3-3,"This was a hidden-yards victory in Atlanta, if there ever was one. Jamison Crowder's 61-yard punt return tilted the game back in Washington's favor early, setting up a Commanders touchdown that put them ahead for good. Kendall Fuller's pick and 23-yard return stunted the Falcons' momentum two minutes into the second half. Washington also stymied Atlanta twice on fourth down, grabbed a red-zone interception and stopped a late two-point attempt. The defense picked off Desmond Ridder three times and consistently gave the offense great field position. It was just strong, complementary football for four quarters -- and a massive departure from the egg the Commanders laid against the Bears in Week 5. But, please, can we keep Sam Howell from getting hit so much?"
2023,7,25,Minnesota Vikings,2-4,"The good news is that the Vikings are now 1-0 without Justin Jefferson this season. The bad news: The offense didn't really have much to do with Sunday's 19-13 win in Chicago. The hope was that Jordan Addison , T.J. Hockenson and maybe Alexander Mattison could each help absorb some of Jefferson's production, and they did, at least to some extent -- but the offense really labored outside of the impressive touchdown drive right before halftime. In six second-half possessions, Minnesota gained a grand total of 36 yards. That left the team's fate in the hands of the defense. Say the words ""backup QB"" to a Vikings fan and watch the color leave that face. Chase Daniel , Cooper Rush and Matt Moore are recent QB2s who have beaten Minnesota, and it looked for a second like Tyson Bagent would join the illustrious club before the defense forced two critical second-half turnovers ."
2023,7,26,Tennessee Titans,2-4,"Ryan Tannehill âs ankle injury sets up a possible preview for the rest of the season at quarterback. When Tannhill left Sundayâs loss to the Ravens , it was Malik Willis who replaced him. Willis did a pretty decent job in the fourth quarter, even if Tyjae Spears â 48-yard screen might have inflated the QBâs stats a bit. But with Tannehillâs future with the team already in question before the injury, you can bet the Titans will consider taking a look at Will Levis , too. Levis has been QB3 in all six games, but now has the door open to show Tennessee why it drafted him with the 34th overall pick in the spring. The Titans arenât cooked at 2-4, but it feels like evaluating both Willis and Levis supersedes winning at all costs now."
2023,7,27,Arizona Cardinals,1-5,"First halves haven't been a problem for the Cardinals, who have outscored opponents by 23 points in the opening 30 minutes of games. Third quarters haven't been terrible, with Arizona getting outscored 34-23. But in the fourth, the Cards have been abysmal, scoring seven points all season (with one touchdown back in the Week 3 upset of Dallas ) while allowing 64 . That's how you arrive at a 1-5 record. Arizona was awful in the red zone on Sunday, too, with Joshua Dobbs kicking off the fourth quarter with a pick down there to prevent the Cardinals from tying the game. The Rams promptly drove 88 yards to extend their lead to 23-9. It didn't help that Dobbs twice had Hollywood Brown open for touchdowns in the first half, but couldn't connect with him either time."
2023,7,28,Denver Broncos,1-5,"It's becoming harder to see how Sean Payton and Russell Wilson are going to thrive in their arranged pairing, considering the Broncos are amid their worst start in nearly 30 years . Wilson has looked solid to strong at times, but mistakes at critical junctures have really marred his play this season. Payton has looked weary at times, even if he's coaxed much better effort from the team since the 50-point loss to the Dolphins. The defense especially came to play in last Thursday's 19-8 loss at Kansas City, and maybe it's a stepping stone for better play down the stretch. But if Denver doesn't get more from Wilson, Jerry Jeudy and the offensive line, it's going to be difficult to project much actual progress toward winning."
2023,7,29,New England Patriots,1-5,"Itâs broken-record time, as the Patriots once again fell in an early (double-digit) hole they couldnât pull themselves out of, stricken by too many mistakes. At least the Pats showed some fight, as they gave themselves a remote chance to pull off a comeback against the Raiders . Following the blowout losses to Dallas and New Orleans , itâs progress. But for anyone holding out hope that thereâs some untapped Bill Belichick magic, Iâd remind them that the roster is in incredibly tough shape. Even in August, with nearly everyone healthy, the personnel (especially on offense) felt thin compared to the other AFC East teams. Now, with so much of the defense banged up, itâs not pretty. Oh, and the Bills and Dolphins are up next."
2023,7,30,Chicago Bears,1-5,"One year ago, Tyson Bagent was preparing for the West Chester Golden Rams, as the quarterback for Division II Shepherd University. This week, with Justin Fields (right thumb) doubtful to play , heâll be studying how to find holes in a Raiders defense that has shut down the opposition the past couple games. In his NFL debut , taking over for an injured Fields, Bagent had some highlights, completing seven straight passes at one point and leading a clutch TD drive, sneaking it in himself from a yard out. But he also was strip-sacked on his third snap and had a bad underthrow on a pass that was picked . With Fields potentially out for a spell, it could be Bagent time in Chicago. He wasnât drafted, but Bagent was far from the worst QB at the Reeseâs Senior Bowl earlier this year, with his current offensive coordinator (Luke Getsy) as one of the gameâs coaches. Bagent is no Fields athletically, but he can move pretty well and spins a nice ball. There will be rough moments, for sure, but something tells me he has something interesting to offer."
2023,7,31,New York Giants,1-5,"Has a team ever lost a game like the Giants did Sunday, finishing both halves at the 1-yard line ? Between the pre-halftime fiasco and end-game letdown , this was the cruelest way to squander Big Blue's best defensive performance in recent memory. For three quarters, New York kept Josh Allen off the board, holding Buffalo to fewer than 150 yards. Brian Daboll seemed to expect even more from that unit when he kicked the field goal on fourth-and-1 from Buffaloâs 11-yard line early in the fourth, all but wasting a great Saquon Barkley drive. Tyrod Taylor did a lot of good things, but his pre-halftime clock error cost the Giants three points. Daboll opted not to go for four more on that fourth-quarter field goal, and Darren Waller could have had six on the final play. The Giants lost by five ."
2023,7,32,Carolina Panthers,0-6,"We might be fresh out of unbeaten teams after Week 6, but we do have one team that stands alone at the bottom -- the 0-6 Panthers, who would have enjoyed this weekâs bye had they somehow found a way to hang onto a 14-0 lead in Miami. It never felt likely, but youâd hardly call Sunday a poor showing. The Panthers ran the ball relatively well, and Bryce Young played a turnover-free game with some encouraging moments. The defense wasnât great but did force three three-and-outs and had a pick-six . Look, I think thereâs a decent chance the Panthers wonât finish the season in this spot, or at the very least, Iâd be shocked if they donât win a game. In fact, Iâll say they win a game before the end of November. There is talent here."
2023,8,1,Kansas City Chiefs,6-1,"The Chiefs were a bit uneven yet again Sunday , with the offense cooling off after halftime. But other than the Nick Bolton 's wrist injury , is there anything from this game to complain about? Kansas City solidly beat a talented opponent. Yeah, the Chargers' record (2-4) stinks, but this was still a divisional victory won by multiple TDs. Charles Omenihu came back from suspension with a sack and a tipped pass that was intercepted at the Chiefs' 6-yard line. Old friend Mecole Hardman had a hand in the triumph, with a 50-yard punt return and a big third-down conversion late. And best friends Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce remain inseparable, despite the fact that their streak of 29 straight completions was broken Sunday. This team just knows how to win."
2023,8,2,Philadelphia Eagles,6-1,"The Eagles were down both starting safeties and their slot corner, and they still held Miami to a season-low 244 yards and 10 offensive points. Tua Tagovailoa was under pressure all game, and even taking into account his ability to get the ball out quickly, it seemed to have a cumulative effect. This is where defensive coordinator Sean Desai might be able to separate himself from his predecessor. I loved how Desai would not let Miami off the hook, providing constant pressure. And while the offense might not quite be operating at that same level as it was last season, the Jalen Hurts - A.J. Brown connection has arguably never been more potent . They've now combined for 701 yards over Brown's past five games. The Eagles also won every big fourth down on Sunday. That's my kind of team. And now Philly's getting Kevin Byard ? Watch out, folks."
2023,8,3,San Francisco 49ers,5-2,"Week 6 in Cleveland, Brock Purdy earned credit after a tough day for putting the 49ers in a position to win, even if that didn't happen . Monday night in Minnesota was shaping up as perfect redemption, but it ended in a nightmare. Purdy was intercepted twice in the fourth quarter on a pair of errant throws , with the latter ending the Niners' comeback attempt in painful fashion. That's now two straight losses after the 5-0 start, and both the Browns and Vikings were able to prevail despite missing key offensive pieces. With Purdy's two picks and Christian McCaffrey 's second lost fumble in three weeks, the 49ers' defense had to be razor-sharp on Monday -- and it wasn't. What an unexpected turn, and now the rested Bengals come to Levi's Stadium on Sunday ."
2023,8,4,Baltimore Ravens,5-2,"The Lions said they wanted to force Lamar Jackson to throw the ball, and the quarterback responded with his best game since early last season. Nine Ravens caught passes Sunday ; six had 30 or more receiving yards. The run game was neatly divided among Gus Edwards , Justice Hill and Jackson. The Ravens' one turnover came when they were already up 28-zip. They punted twice, holding a lead of 30-plus points on both. It was a banner day on defense, too, as Baltimore smothered Detroitâs dangerous offense early. It was the kind of statement victory that makes you think the Ravens have as good a shot to make the Super Bowl as any AFC team right now. A 10-2 record at the bye wouldnât be shocking, but Baltimore must prove its offense has taken the proverbial next step."
2023,8,5,Miami Dolphins,5-2,"Miami's offense hit a new low in Philadelphia , managing just 10 offensive points. True, the Dolphins were limited by the Eagles to eight turns with the ball, but even so, there were too many empty possessions before the late red-zone pick that set Philly up to take a two-score lead. Tyreek Hill 's dropped TD pass didn't hurt, because Miami got a pick-six two plays later, but it was uncharacteristic of the receiver. The ground attack looked dormant in its second game without De'Von Achane , and the offensive line suffered a setback. This is where the Dolphins are now, with the (resurgent?) Patriots and Chiefs (in Frankfurt) up next before the bye. Xavien Howard and Connor Williams might be back soon. Near the break, Achane, Terron Armstead and perhaps Jalen Ramsey could return . The Dolphins can still be dangerous, but quality teams have leaned into them."
2023,8,6,Jacksonville Jaguars,5-2,"Sunday's upcoming game in Pittsburgh is shaping up as a huge measuring-stick contest for both teams. The Jaguars' win on Thursday -- their fourth straight -- gave them a pleasurable mini-bye, as a banged-up Trevor Lawrence got the job done, even if there are still some kinks to work out. The offense has shown a pattern of bogging down in the second half. Travis Etienne is on pace for a whopping 367 touches. Calvin Ridley has more games with three or fewer catches than with four or more. The defense has been too reliant on takeaways. But all that said, the Jaguars have righted the ship and are in pole position in the AFC South. If they weather this next stretch of games before and after the Week 9 bye, the division can be theirs again."
2023,8,7,Detroit Lions,5-2,"No two ways about it: This one was ugly -- to the point that Detroit's credentials must be questioned. The Lions allowed four TDs in their first four defensive series. On offense, they went three-and-out three straight times to open the game, then turned it over on downs. Everything after that was more or less immaterial. As tough to swallow as the Week 2 Seattle loss was, especially defensively, it was a close, hard-fought game, and Detroit came back to rip off four straight wins. How will the Lions respond to this defeat? The good news is that the Raiders are up next , followed by a Week 9 bye. There's time to bury this one. The season feels too special for anyone to get off the bandwagon now. We're not necessarily buying stock after Sunday, but we're certainly not dumping it, either."
2023,8,8,Dallas Cowboys,4-2,"Even with the defense showing some game-to-game inconsistency, the Cowboys can become a better team with Dak Prescott playing more like he did against the Chargers . Early this season, the Cowboys were lucky they didnât need more out of the offense, but in big moments against Arizona and San Francisco , that unit came up short. Youâd like to see more from Brandin Cooks , Michael Gallup and the tight ends in the pass game and more ground production overall. Thereâs also the matter of Mike McCarthy trying to rediscover his play-caller vibe. Maybe the strides the 'Boys took against the Chargers and a healthy Tyron Smith suggest more offensive flourish is coming. The good news is that they have more home games than road games remaining."
2023,8,9,Buffalo Bills,4-3,"Itâs instinctive to ask whatâs wrong with the offense because weâve come to expect Josh Allen and Co. to solve mid-game problems, or at least overwhelm them. But the Bills ultimately scored enough to beat a Patriots team that hadnât topped 17 points since mid-September. Buffaloâs defense and special teams typically have been reliable more often than not. Sunday they were not. Taron Johnson âs penalty wiped out a sack, then he allowed the go-ahead TD in Sunday's 29-25 loss . The pass rush was quiet against a bad Patriots O-line. Buffalo couldnât tackle Rhamondre Stevenson . The Bills just canât expect a unit missing TreâDavious White , Matt Milano , Ed Oliver and DaQuan Jones (and with Von Miller working back into form) to carry this team when the offense gets off to slow starts."
2023,8,10,Cleveland Browns,4-2,"After another outlandish game comes another week of the Browns not knowing what the franchise quarterback is going to offer them. They found a way to win for a second straight time with PJ Walker and Kareem Hunt playing big roles. Whether this can be maintained is anyone's guess, but with the statuses of Deshaun Watson and Jerome Ford unclear , Cleveland might have to run it back for a third time. As long as the Browns have Myles Gar r ett , things might be OK . And how valuable has Dustin Hopkins been? For the cost of a 2025 seventh-round pick, Cleveland landed a kicker who is 16 of 18 on field-goal tries, including a 7-for-7 mark from 50-plus yards out."
2023,8,11,Seattle Seahawks,4-2,"Geno Smith isn't slumping, per se , but he's been a bit off the past two weeks. Smith didn't throw a single red-zone interception all last season, and he hadn't done so this season heading into Week 6, but he now has tossed two crippling red-zone picks in two weeks. Late in the third quarter and up 7 points on Sunday , Smith needed to be a little smarter with where he was throwing it. Soon after that pick, Smith coughed up a center exchange . He also got away with a dropped INT right before the half. It wasn't all bad, nor was it the week before, but Smith has lost some sharpness. The good news is that Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Jake Bobo got cooking, adding more layers to this offense. I really want to dislike Bobo, given that he went to my rival high school, but he's been a terrific surprise."
2023,8,12,Cincinnati Bengals,3-3,"Is there a way to kick-start the run game? That had to be a discussion topic for Cincinnati over the bye. The Bengals' ground attack wasn't very explosive last year, but it was effective. This season, it has been neither. The good news is that we're really talking about making incremental gains over the final 11 games. The bad news is that the personnel is arguably worse. Joe Mixon can't make people miss this year, and the Bengals have yet to identify an effective RB2. I know Joe Burrow 's at his best out of the shotgun, but it's worth asking why the Bengals have seven under-center snaps in six games after logging more than 200 a year ago."
2023,8,13,Pittsburgh Steelers,4-2,"Boy, if this team could figure out its first-half (and sometimes first-three-quarters) offensive slumps, we might have something here. The Steelers gained 192 of their 300 yards in the win over the Rams during the fourth quarter, via three drives: TD, TD, four-minute offense. That's pretty much football nirvana for Mike Tomlin, dominating a team in the final stanza on the road. But it's like I tell my kids all the time: It doesn't have to be this hard . Still, somehow, it works. An offense like this can't afford to have George Pickens and Diontae Johnson flagged for taunting. Pickens put up his second straight 100-yard game, but he also had another bad penalty in the first quarter that likely cost Pittsburgh points. The Steelers are riding the razor's edge, but maybe you can do that when you have T.J. Watt ."
2023,8,14,New York Jets,3-3,"The Jets really faced a gauntlet over their first six games; getting to the bye at 3-3 was a semi-heroic achievement for the Fighting Robert Salehs. Would you give up on this team if Aaron Rodgers had led it to the same record? Of course not. Losing Rodgers and Alijah Vera-Tucker for the long term puts a cap on New York's ceiling. Zach Wilson also kind of admitted that the Eagles gave teams the blueprint for defending the Jets: press them at the line and make them beat you over the top. If the Jets show they can counter that strategy, there really is a path to the playoffs. Maybe with Rodgers on the field again ? OK, let's at least get to Thanksgiving, then we can unpack all of the fantastical scenarios."
2023,8,15,Houston Texans,3-3,"C.J. Stroud is fourth in passing yards per game, and I really don't care that much about it. The gaudy statistics are nice -- I should mention that he's on pace for 4,700 yards, 25 TDs and three picks -- but they only tell a small part of the rookie's impressive story. To me, Stroud's poise and smarts have taken center stage. He's kept the ball out of harm's way (one INT, three fumbles). He's cut down on sacks dramatically (11 in Weeks 1-2, two in four games since). And Stroud has been really good in fourth quarters (SEE: 114.7 QB rating). And with Stroud, Will Anderson Jr. , Tank Dell , Henry To'oTo'o and others giving Houston its best rookie class in recent memory, there's a lot for Texans fans to be excited about."
2023,8,16,Atlanta Falcons,4-3,"Regardless of what happened with Bijan Robinson , the Falcons went on the road and beat a division rival without their best offensive player against a quality defense. That's the positive. Desmond Ridder following up a three-pick game with a three-fumble game wasn't on my bingo card, but with his turnovers starting to rack up, perhaps I should have chosen cards more wisely. Ridder has clearly made strides as a thrower, reinvigorating tight end Kyle Pitts and springing more chunk passes. He's also earned his stamp as an effective runner. But he and everyone else knows these turnovers have to stop."
2023,8,17,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-3,"The good vibes of the Bucs' 3-1 start have fizzled. They have gone backward offensively since the Week 5 bye. The run game remains MIA. The defense has played well enough in two straight games, but they've lost both at home. On the surface, Baker Mayfield 's stat line of 275 passing yards and a 31-yard run on Sunday look pretty nifty. But his play, along with much of the offense, has dipped in recent outings. Is there hope for improvement in the passing game? Perhaps some, maybe in the big-play department? That said, Tampa has protected Mayfield well this season, and he hasn't been throwing balls up for grabs. What we've seen to this point just might be somewhat close to the Buccaneers' offensive ceiling."
2023,8,18,Los Angeles Rams,3-4,"When Matthew Stafford scrambled for a first down on third-and-7 late in the third quarter, I thought the Rams were going to go up two touchdowns and finish off the Steelers. They'd controlled the ball for nearly 29 minutes at one point, against the Steelers' 16. But the game then tilted in Pittsburgh's favor, starting with Brett Maher 's missed field-goal try, his second of the day. He also missed an extra-point attempt. You blink, and the Rams are suddenly 3-4 and dealing with kicker issues. It's been a strange start to the season, alternately promising and frustrating. A lack of healthy running backs was a factor for L.A. on Sunday; it really would be fun to see this offense operating at peak performance. Next up: at Dallas . UPDATE: On Tuesday, the Rams released kicker Brett Maher ."
2023,8,19,New Orleans Saints,3-4,"The Saints' fourth-quarter flourish shouldn't make anyone assume their offensive issues are fixed. It took too long for New Orleans to find any consistent rhythm against the Jaguars, and the story for most of Thursday's game -- just as it was four days earlier, in Week 6 -- was that Derek Carr and his pass catchers seemingly operate on different wavelengths too often. New Orleans went 0-for-3 in the red zone against the Texans and 3-for-18 on third down against the Jaguars. Carr and Chris Olave especially can't seem to get in a groove. Olave is roughly on the same production pace as he was in his rookie year, but he's only caught 17 of his past 36 targets. That can't continue. To make matters worse, Olave was arrested for reckless operation of a motor vehicle on Monday."
2023,8,20,Minnesota Vikings,3-4,"The wild goal-line sequence in the third quarter that ended in a Minnesota field goal made me think the Vikings were going to blow the game. That decision felt flawed at the time, and the 49ers came right back and scored. But I give Kevin O'Connell credit for his game plan on the whole (which limited possessions) and his trust in the defense (which made big stops in crunch time). KOC also called a terrific game for Kirk Cousins . To his own credit, Cousins made a ton of terrific throws under fire, enjoying one of his best outings in recent memory. Jordan Addison missed a chunk of the game to injury, but the rookie wideout was absolutely tremendous, especially after losing that early pass on the interception. We're not quite back in 2022 mode, but this team is suddenly dangerous again."
2023,8,21,Indianapolis Colts,3-4,"It's likely going to be Gardner Minshew the rest of the way, and boy, is he a roller coaster. Shane Steichen knew this going in, as he saw how volatile Minshew can be in a starting role during their time together with the Eagles. There was a lot of good in the loss to the Browns -- two passing touchdowns and two rushing scores -- but still too much bad. His four turnovers led to 17 Cleveland points, including a strip-sack TD . This comes on the heels of a four-turnover performance in Week 6 at Jacksonville . It might be time to recalibrate exactly what a successful season might end up looking like for Indianapolis, considering both the 2-1 start and Anthony Richardson 's season-ending injury. The Colts should have won this game, but the margin for error shrinks with every turnover Minshew dishes out."
2023,8,22,Los Angeles Chargers,2-4,"It took too long for the Chargers to get out of the zone defense that Patrick Mahomes was carving up on Sunday . Asante Samuel Jr. 's interception seemed to inspire the coaches to play more man, and it worked, as the Chiefs scored 14 points on their final six possessions (vs. 17 on their first four). The Chargers ultimately gave up too much ground early, a familiar theme this season. Even so, this offense has just been way too inconsistent. The Bolts have now struggled to score in three straight second halves (they registered zero points in two of those halves), committing turnovers in each. Is it a Justin Herbert problem? A Kellen Moore problem? Some other factor? Whatever the case, until that trend changes, the Bolts will look like a non-playoff team."
2023,8,23,Green Bay Packers,2-4,"In Sunday's loss to the Broncos, Jordan Love threw a pick in his fourth straight game. Packers fans just aren't used to this level of carelessness from their quarterback -- this is Matt Flynn country after all, so I get it. I haven't looked at a mock draft since April, so forgive me, but at this point, I'll assume some Green Bay backers are skipping a few steps and giving the team a new first-round quarterback, no questions asked. The idea of giving up on Love this early in the season feels wild, though. Sean Clifford would be Plan B, so my plea is for patience. Sunday's pick was a killer, but Love did a few quality things before it."
2023,8,24,Las Vegas Raiders,3-4,"All signs seemed to point toward Aidan O'Connell getting the start in Chicago, but Josh McDaniels opted instead for Brian Hoyer , who ultimately managed just 129 yards passing while throwing two picks in the 30-12 loss . Once Jimmy Garoppolo is back, if McDaniels wants to make Hoyer the game-day backup, so be it. He's 38 years old and better prepared to come off the bench at the drop of a helmet. But not starting O'Connell (or at least going to him at halftime) felt like a mistake, even though the rookie experienced some struggles in his first NFL start back in Week 4 against the Chargers . Hoyer has started four games since 2019 and didn't come out of any of them looking good. He's also lost 13 straight starts. Does McDaniels want to see what O'Connell can do? Or is he quietly concerned about his job status? We're not sure, but let's hope he considers a new approach the next time he's presented with this choice."
2023,8,25,Washington Commanders,3-4,"The 3-4 record cosmetically hides the fact that two of those losses came to the previously 0-4 Bears and now the Giants , who entered Sunday at 1-5. Sam Howell has done some good things, and we know Washington has dudes at receiver ... So why is the offense so painfully inconsistent? It goes without saying that an O-line that allows six sacks and commits seven penalties is a big reason why. Every one of the sacks was for minus-7 yards or worse. Howell must play with more awareness, but what about OC Eric Bieniemy and OL coach Travelle Wharton? They had no answers for the Giants' stunts and blitzes all game. Just another step backward after the 2-0 start."
2023,8,26,Tennessee Titans,2-4,"Ryan Tannehill (high ankle sprain) remains out indefinitely , Treylon Burks and Chig Okonkwo are having a disappointing sophomore campaign and the once-ballyhooed pass rush has gone AWOL. Oh, and the Titans are 0-3 away from home and soon face a three-game road swing, all vs. opponents that are currently .500 or better. Time to start evaluating Will Levis ? My suspicion: If Tennessee is anywhere near contention, Mike Vrabel will continue pushing for the playoffs, delaying Levis' audition. We've seen Malik Willis and know what he is to this point. But Vrabel and the Titans must be smart about knowing when to turn to 2024. I'm guessing the Falcons regret not giving Desmond Ridder a longer look last year, and that's a place in which the Titans don't want to end up."
2023,8,27,Denver Broncos,2-5,"When I heard Sean Payton asking rhetorically Monday, "" Why can't I be happy? "" following the Broncos' rousing win , I just got sad. The Broncos went from giving up 70 to Miami to turning in back-to-back strong defensive showings, and this is where Payton's head is. I suspect it has something to do with the limitations of his team's passing game, but it might also continue with the four-game suspension for Kareem Jackson for multiple violations of unnecessary roughness rules. With the overall defensive improvement -- more Drew Sanders , please! -- and the effective RB duo of Javonte Williams and Jaleel McLaughlin , there are far more things to smile about than there were a few weeks ago. Cheer up, coach!"
2023,8,28,New England Patriots,2-5,"This was really Mac Jones ' signature NFL win. He beat the Bills as a rookie , but that was in a three-pass, wind-whipped game in Buffalo. The Bills had gotten him four straight times since then, including the playoff blowout , with Mac throwing seven combined INTs in those games. Jones last led his team back in the fourth quarter to victory in Week 5 of 2021 against a moribund Texans team . The returns of Cole Strange and Michael Onwenu helped the offensive line, and Demario Douglas and Pharaoh Brown proved they deserve bigger roles in the passing game. All that said, this rousing win came against a beat-up Bills team, and we can't exactly memory-hole the three previous games. A sign of progress or a one-game analgesic? With Miami up next , we could find out quickly."
2023,8,29,Chicago Bears,2-5,"I have to imagine Sunday's 30-12 blowout of the Raiders was among the more pleasurable games for Bears fans to watch over the past few years. Chicago went up 14-0 early and scored points in every quarter. The defense produced three takeaways and didn't allow a play longer than 15 yards. The run game was forceful, creative and fruitful. And yes, Tyson Bagent looked the part in his first NFL start, leading four scoring drives and not turning it over against a Las Vegas defense that had played well recently. By halftime, it was easy to forget Bagent faced the likes of Southern Connecticut State, Kutztown and East Stroudsburg one year ago. Even if the undrafted rookie out of Shepherd University never rises past backup status, he's already been an NFL success, just making it to this point this fast."
2023,8,30,New York Giants,2-5,"I am not ready to entertain the idea of keeping Daniel Jones on the bench even after he's medically cleared, but it's hard not to notice how much more open the offense has been with Tyrod Taylor under center. Either way, it appears Andrew Thomas is close to returning, and there's a decent argument to be made that he's New York's MVP, given how poorly left tackle has been manned in his absence. The 14-7 triumph over the Commanders was a good win for the Giants, with both the offense and defense slaying some demons. The G-Men won't have a lot more six-sack games, but I'll be shocked if their pass rush going forward isn't closer to what we witnessed Sunday than everything we'd seen previously. And suddenly, there are some winnable games lying ahead."
2023,8,31,Arizona Cardinals,1-6,"The Joshua Dobbs story has been pretty tremendous, all things considered, but anyone still droning on about not playing Kyler Murray needs to reconsider their position. Murray appears on track for a Week 10-ish return , assuming all goes well in his return to practice. The offense opened against Seattle with three punts, then a field goal, but that came after a fumble recovery returned to Seattle's 30-yard line. The Cardinals got another fumble at the Seattle 34 in the fourth quarter and turned that into a missed field goal. Arizona won the turnover battle 3-0 but didn't take advantage. Dobbs' TD run was pretty, and he rallied a bit, but his limitations are starting to show. It will be fascinating to see how Murray looks roughly 11 months after we last saw him. And I'm ready to see him."
2023,8,32,Carolina Panthers,0-6,"While the Panthers sat on bye, many of the teams immediately above them won games. Much of the recent talk in Charlotte has revolved around which Carolina players could be on the move before the Oct. 31 trade deadline , one year after the team dealt Christian McCaffrey and Robbie Chosen . The biggest name to watch this time around is DE Brian Burns , who staged a hold-in during the preseason and was a hot name prior to last year's deadline . According to one report , the Panthers apparently turned down a Rams offer of two first-round picks and a second-rounder in exchange for Burns last October. Think Carolina would be interested in that kind of deal at this juncture? Maybe the Panthers actually trade for a receiver to help out Bryce Young . Carolina should be open for business. But it also wouldn't hurt to win a game, if for nothing else than to just give this group a little hope."
2023,9,1,Philadelphia Eagles,7-1,"If Tyreek Hill is an MVP candidate in Miami, then A.J. Brown absolutely should be in that discussion, too. Brown has been on a six-week tear, logging 125-plus receiving yards in every game over that span, adding another two TDs in Sunday's heroic performance . The Eagles don't beat the Commanders without the greatness of Brown and Jalen Hurts , both of whom were in peak form . It was once again a rough day in the red zone (Philly went 3-for-5, but lost two fumbles inside the 5-yard line), which has been a lingering issue, and the defense really had few answers for Sam Howell . The Eagles won in spite of those factors. Of course, expecting to do the same in Week 9's massive showdown with the Cowboys would be foolish."
2023,9,2,Baltimore Ravens,6-2,"There were minimal signs of an emotional letdown for the Ravens after Week 7's trouncing of the Lions. Lamar Jackson did little, but they didn't need him to do much. They allowed Arizona to hang around too long, but in the end, this was a solid road win . They'll take it, with the next three games (and six of the final nine) in Baltimore. That's the good news. The bad? Most of the remaining opponents look fairly tough or better. And the AFC North has muscled up a bit since the Ravens last played a divisional game. Still, they're 6-2, tied atop the AFC and arguably playing as well as anyone in the conference. This week's opponent , the Seahawks, could be one big win away from making that claim on the NFC side. The Ravens' steep march to the playoffs begins in earnest."
2023,9,3,Miami Dolphins,6-2,"If they can find a way to get the offensive line in some sort of functional shape, the Dolphins should be OK. The imminent returns of Terron Armstead and Connor Williams will be a boon, although Robert Hunt 's situation tempers the optimism around that unit a bit. De'Von Achane will be eligible to come off IR after the Germany game , and that would be another big boost. The secondary also can get better from within, once Xavien Howard and Jevon Holland are in the lineup again. Jalen Ramsey 's debut in Sunday's win over the Patriots was more than anyone could have hoped for. He had an interception , was active in run support and played nearly the whole game. It feels like Miami picked up a starter at the trade deadline."
2023,9,4,Kansas City Chiefs,6-2,"The Chiefs have not known life as anything but a No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the playoffs under Patrick Mahomes , but if they want to maintain their hopes of securing a top seed this year, they might be looking at a must-win game this Sunday in Frankfurt , where they'll to face the Dolphins, one of three other 6-2 AFC teams currently. The fact is, the Chiefs were beaten soundly by a team they'd defeated in 16 straight previous matchups, and Mahomes didn't mount anything close to a comeback after falling behind early Sunday. Stricken with the flu , he didn't play well, although a few huge drops and a suddenly shaky offensive line didn't help."
2023,9,5,Jacksonville Jaguars,6-2,"With a five-win October, Jacksonville exorcised the demons of its 1-2 start and now is 6-2 for the first time this millennium. The victory over the Steelers lacked style points, but the Jaguars' recent travel schedule, the number of starters they were missing and the Pittsburgh weather all were contributing factors. The Jags were lucky their three turnovers (two in the red zone, one just outside it) didn't hurt more, and it's a little concerning how dependent on Travis Etienne they've become. The Week 9 bye will provide some much-needed rest; then we'll find out if the Jaguars can stack up against the AFC contenders left on their schedule. Right now, they look like they belong."
2023,9,6,Dallas Cowboys,5-2,"The Cowboys have picked themselves off the mat since the 49ers debacle in Week 5 . A gut-check road win in Week 6 , the Week 7 bye and the three-phase destruction of the Rams -- a get-right game for the offense if ever there was one -- have been cleansing. On Sunday, Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb were as locked in as they've ever been. The early pass protection was frightening, and Tyron Smith returning would be huge, although that unit settled in eventually. Since losing to San Francisco, the Cowboys have answered several questions. But more loom in Week 9, which will feature the biggest game for the Cowboys in forever, a trip to Philly that rates five out of five stars on the Madden-Summerall 4:25 ET scale."
2023,9,7,Detroit Lions,6-2,"After the blowout loss at Baltimore, I thought the Lions were poised to come out on Monday night and blow the roof off Ford Field. Instead, Detroit's drives repeatedly bogged down in Las Vegas territory, making the game a lot tighter than it should have been. Three Lions turnovers -- including a brutal, 75-yard pick-six -- also allowed the Raiders to hang around. Credit Aaron Glenn's defense for consistently harassing Jimmy Garoppolo ; third-year DT Alim McNeill might be a Pro Bowler. Meanwhile, No. 12 overall pick Jahmyr Gibbs enjoyed a breakout game (189 yards and a touchdown on 31 touches), serving as Detroit's offensive engine with David Montgomery sidelined by injury. The Lions had to shuffle some pieces on the offensive line, but the results were great, as Gibbs and Craig Reynolds really carved up Las Vegas' run defense. Not the prettiest win , and you can bet Dan Campbell rues the sloppiness, but it was an important victory after the Lions' credentials were questioned a bit last week."
2023,9,8,San Francisco 49ers,5-3,"During San Francisco's first two losses, in Cleveland and Minnesota , it felt like the 49ers were a good team grinding through a rough patch. Sunday's home defeat to the Bengals made them look vulnerable for the first time this season. Between Brock Purdy 's turnover spree and a defense that suddenly can't get off the field in big spots, San Francisco is dealing with multiple new issues. I don't know if the Niners can suddenly rediscover their clutch gene; either way, the Week 9 bye might be hitting at the right time. It's pretty rare to lose three straight regular-season games and go on to win a Super Bowl, but the Rams did it a couple years ago. Though the 49ers have crashed hard, their early-season dominance backs up a potential rebound scenario. For now, we're hanging onto them, just not as tightly as before."
2023,9,9,Buffalo Bills,5-3,"After a closer-than-it-shoulda-been win over the Buccaneers, the proving-ground portion of the schedule kicks off, starting with Sunday Night Football in Cincinnati against the scorching-hot Bengals, who thumped the Bills in the playoffs this past January. It feels like a game that will come with a playoff-like atmosphere, as could some other big roadies down the stretch: at Philly in Week 12, at Kansas City in Week 14 and at Miami in Week 18. Josh Allen 's big outing against the Bucs -- though it was accompanied by a few scary moments -- helped steady Buffalo's ship a bit, but there is plenty to clean up before this gauntlet. You'd like to see the Bills close the door better in fourth quarters. With the defense as shorthanded as it is, can they do it against even better teams?"
2023,9,10,Seattle Seahawks,5-2,"The win over Cleveland was Seattle's fifth in six games, and the defense has played a big role of late. After allowing 88 points over their first three games of the season, the Seahawks have held opponents to 50 points in four games since, and now that unit is adding big Leonard Williams inside. The 'Hawks sit atop the NFC West and are clearly going for it. Still, they were lucky Browns QB PJ Walker committed several unforced errors in the second half on Sunday -- including an interception off Jamal Adams ' helmet -- even if Seattle's pressure had something to do with it. The Browns controlled the ball for just under 37 minutes, racking up 385 yards and softening the run defense. I've said that this offense can endure cold streaks, but going seven straight third downs without a conversion is taking it too far. Geno Smith and the passing game must tighten up prior to some upcoming defensive battles on the road."
2023,9,11,Cincinnati Bengals,4-3,"Don't look now, but Joe Burrow and the Bengals are hot, with the offense and defense quickly making huge strides following a 1-3 start. Sunday's victory over San Francisco marked the first time this season one could say Cincinnati resembled a team capable of winning the Super Bowl. Burrow connected on 19 straight passes at one point against the 49ers, and the Bengals' defense forced three turnovers, holding the Niners to 10 points over the final 48-plus minutes. Getting Tee Higgins and Joe Mixon back in a little groove helped, and Cincy could have scored more, had Irv Smith Jr. not fumbled near the goal line. The Bengals are back, just in time for a huge matchup at home vs. the Bills on Sunday Night Football ."
2023,9,12,Cleveland Browns,4-3,"PJ Walker has been a savior, helping keep the Browns' season afloat amid the weekly questions about Deshaun Watson 's health. Though Walker was humming early on Sunday , his second-quarter INT deep in Seattle territory was a killer, as was his fourth-quarter pick with less than two minutes to go, which set up the game-winning score for the Seahawks. Walker's limitations have always been clear -- but now they're embossed in neon, with him logging six turnovers and a 49.5 completion percentage over nearly three full games. The Browns erased a 14-0 deficit at a hostile road venue in Seattle, taking the lead with less than three minutes left. But the defensive breakdowns early and late, plus Walker's inconsistency, kept them from winning a third straight in dramatic fashion."
2023,9,13,New York Jets,4-3,"The Jets' social media team had a little fun at my expense Sunday, and there's absolutely something to be said for this squad's unwillingness to quit until the clock hits zero. It's a big reason why the Jets are above .500. But let's be real: They were more than lucky to win, in OT, against a Giants team with negative passing yards. The chances of that type of lightning striking again come down to slim and none . This isn't bitterness talking; it's reality. The Jets committed nine penalties, punted 11 times and were 2-for-15 on third down, with one of those conversion attempts ending when Zach Wilson lost a fumble in the first quarter. That just won't cut it with a fairly tough remaining schedule."
2023,9,14,New Orleans Saints,4-4,"The offense had its most complete game in Sunday's win over the Colts , looking nothing like the stop-start unit we've seen much of the season. The Taysom Hill package was expanded a bit and was as effective as it's been in 2023. Rashid Shaheed cashed in on three deep balls. The Saints allowed one sack and one turnover, and they happened on the same play . Derek Carr was pretty darned dialed in , and the run game -- often going right up the gut -- was effective. Who are these guys? It was on the road, and the Colts aren't terrible defensively most weeks. Even as the offense took two steps forward, though, the Saints' run defense took (at least) one step backward in that unit's worst showing. But at 4-4, New Orleans is just as much a contender in the NFC South race as anyone else."
2023,9,15,Pittsburgh Steelers,4-3,"Two straight wins had Steelers fans believing again. Then came Sunday's defeat to the Jaguars, which was painful in multiple ways, with two of Pittsburgh's most indispensable players, S Minkah Fitzpatrick and QB Kenny Pickett , exiting with injuries . Fitzpatrick is arguably the Steelers' most important piece, both because of his skill and because of the drop-off behind him on the depth chart. The fact that his hamstring injury happened ahead of a short week makes it even less ideal. The next two games (home vs. the Titans and Packers ) are winnable, but Tennessee enters the upcoming Thursday Night Football matchup with confidence after Will Levis ' sparkling debut. While the sailing never figured to be smooth for these Steelers, navigating this stretch -- potentially with backups playing significant roles -- will be key before they face a tough road duo to close out November ( at Cleveland , at Cincinnati )."
2023,9,16,Houston Texans,3-4,"This was a tough way for the Texans to come out of the bye, losing in the final minutes of a game they led for virtually the entire fourth quarter. The defense has done its job since the start of October, even if it couldn't get off the field in the final six-plus minutes on Sunday, with four late penalties doing them in. But the bigger issue is that the offense has leveled off following C.J. Stroud 's hot start. The Texans' lack of a threatening rushing attack meant the Panthers could drop seven and eight, play zone and force Stroud to take checkdowns all game. This is where first-year offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik can try to help his rookie quarterback out a little more with creative scheming, although the Texans clearly still have offensive-personnel limitations."
2023,9,17,Atlanta Falcons,4-4,"Desmond Ridder 's exit to be evaluated for a concussion opened the door for Arthur Smith to make a permanent change to Taylor Heinicke , even if Smith said after Sunday's loss to the Titans that Ridder wasn't benched for performance. The 23 points Sunday were the most Atlanta has scored since Week 2, though; previously, Ridder's penchant for turnovers (he had another one Sunday before leaving) have limited the Falcons' scoring opportunities. Ridder led Atlanta to three first-half points, while Heinicke guided four scoring drives in the second, totaling 20 points and giving Atlanta a chance to win after being down multiple scores. On top of all that, the loss of DT Grady Jarrett to a torn ACL rips a hole in the defense at a spot where the Falcons are most thin. Back to the drawing board."
2023,9,18,Los Angeles Chargers,3-4,"Justin Herbert and Brandon Staley suggested after defeating the Bears that this was exactly the kind of win the Chargers needed, and I absolutely agree -- from a confidence standpoint. Sometimes you need to open it up on the highway; Herbert and the passing game certainly did that Sunday night, even if the run game still lags behind. But let's keep the big picture in mind here. The Chargers are still swimming upstream at 3-4 (and 1-3 in the conference), and I am not convinced that taking down Chicago and a Division-II rookie QB making his second NFL start was the get-right event that immediately veers the season back on course. The Bolts face mostly tough defenses from here on out (if you believe the Broncos are fixed) and will need their own defense to tighten several screws."
2023,9,19,Minnesota Vikings,4-4,"The Vikings find themselves in a similar place to the Jets: nominally in contention, but facing some hard questions at quarterback. Kirk Cousins ' devastating Achilles injury opens up the possibility that he's played his final game for the club, and it puts the Vikings into a fascinating short-term quandary, as they currently sit in the No. 7 playoff spot in the NFC. It doesn't feel like there's a Brett Favre-like answer just waiting for the phone to ring, even if everyone knows whom Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell once backed up as a Patriots player. More likely, it's Jaren Hall or Sean Mannion or Nick Mullens , or some combination of them. If this is it for Cousins in Minnesota, it's a cruel twist of fate. He'd been playing some really good football. Neither he nor Vikings fans deserved this. UPDATE: On Tuesday, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported that the Vikings are trading for Cardinals QB Josh Dobbs ."
2023,9,20,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-4,"After a 3-1 start, Tampa has lost three straight, and now -- in the thick of a tough portion of the schedule -- we'll see if this team is built to last. The Buccaneers are on the road for five of their next seven games. Their 2-1 record away from home (including Thursday's competitive loss to the Bills) suggests they can hang with most teams. Can the offense produce more scoring chances? In three games since the early bye, they have three TDs, five field goals, five drives that ended with turnovers (two on downs) and 15 punts. If Baker Mayfield can play a little more consistently and the offensive line can avoid crippling penalties, maybe the Bucs can convert a few more of those possessions into points. They're going to need to."
2023,9,21,Los Angeles Rams,3-5,"Things have soured, and now, after QB Matthew Stafford 's thumb injury , a potentially winnable Week 9 matchup against the struggling Packers looks dicey. Even though it worked , It's hard to justify Sean McVay calling a two-point throw to Stafford in Sunday's loss to Dallas after his QB had already twice been hit on his (surgically repaired) right thumb. We saw the drop-off when Brett Rypien came in, as he couldn't get much going. L.A. is on bye after the Green Bay trip, and if you're a Rams fan, you're praying for a healthy Stafford and Kyren Williams when they host surging Seattle in Week 11 . With the team at 3-5, the season is perilously tilting in the wrong direction."
2023,9,22,Tennessee Titans,3-4,"It was pretty obvious during the pre-draft process that Will Levis had physical skills. The concerns about his game -- which I suspect contributed to his fall out of Round 1 -- seemed to mostly center on his suspect pocket presence and decision-making . So it was one thing for him to flash his physical abilities in his first NFL start -- and we don't want to gloss over his three deep touchdown passes, each prettier than the last. But it was another thing for him to deliver a poised, mature and turnover-free performance, one that could make Levis the unquestioned starter at least until Ryan Tannehill returns. Three straight road games could dampen the optimism coming out of Sunday's win over Atlanta , but for now, the Titans remain in the race at 3-4, with an intriguing wild card in Levis suddenly emerging. UPDATE: Head coach Mike Vrabel told reporters Tuesday that Will Levis is expected to start Thursday against the Steelers."
2023,9,23,Indianapolis Colts,3-5,"It's fun to see the potential of this offense, with Jonathan Taylor looking better each game and Zack Moss not slowing down . The seeds are mostly there for something really interesting down the road. Gardner Minshew was slinging it on Sunday until the wheels came off, and four different receivers had impact performances against the Saints . But everything was rendered null and void by the defense's inability to force more than one set of back-to-back stops, not counting the halftime kneeldown. Those consecutive stops came as the Colts were regaining momentum, but Minshew was picked, and then the D allowed two straight TDs. When Indy's front doesn't dominate, the shorthanded secondary struggles. It's a tough development for a defense that has done some decent things this season."
2023,9,24,Denver Broncos,3-5,"Talk of playoffs might be premature, but this team has completely changed its stripes since giving up 70 points to Miami in Week 3 , and a sub-.500 season is no longer close to a sure thing. Offensively, things remain somewhat unvarnished, but a month of incremental improvements bore fruit: Denver's first win over the Chiefs since the Peyton Manning days. That's a testament to a defense moving in the right direction (how about guys like Ja'Quan McMillian , Zach Allen and Baron Browning ?) and a run game that has become Denver's engine. The Broncos hit the Week 9 bye knowing four of their next six games are on the road, but there's at least a sense of steadiness that simply wasn't there a few weeks back."
2023,9,25,Green Bay Packers,2-5,"Last week , I preached patience with Jordan Love . This week, I am a little antsier. The turnovers just have to stop. I promise if you go back and watch Love's first three games over again, you'll see a different quarterback than the one we've seen in the four losses since. His accuracy, touch and ball placement have been the biggest culprits. Rasheed Walker was benched Sunday (before re-entering the game) for giving up some pressures, but I don't think pass protection has been Green Bay's biggest issue this season. The defense hasn't been, either, though on Sunday , the unit wasn't great at slowing down Kirk Cousins before his injury. This is just a team adrift right now, badly in need of hope in one form or another."
2023,9,26,Las Vegas Raiders,3-5,"The lack of a consistent passing game just killed the Raiders on Monday night , especially when they couldn't stop Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs on defense. Jimmy Garoppolo returned from injury, but never got in a groove, telegraphing a first-quarter pick and looking skittish throughout. A big part of that was because of the consistent Detroit pressure, though costly drops from Davante Adams and Hunter Renfrow didn't help. Even when Garoppolo wasn't under fire, he never looked comfortable, taking six sacks and overthrowing an open Adams twice on deep shots in the second half. Tough as Jimmy is, it just wasn't his night . UPDATE: On Tuesday night, the Raiders fired head coach Josh McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler."
2023,9,27,Washington Commanders,3-5,"After Sunday's loss knocked the Commanders back to 3-5, all eyes turned to what they might do at the trade deadline. Losing five of six games after the 2-0 start has put them here, thanks to this team's often maddening inconsistency. Do we give Washington credit for battling the Eagles to the bitter end in two games this season? Some, yes, but how can we justify the losses to the Bears and Giants ? Those performances looked nothing like the two games against Philly or the road wins at Denver and Atlanta . Sam Howell showed why any talk of benching him was silly, and it was nice to see the improved pass protection and play calling after weeks of poor performance in those areas. But this team made its own bed, which is why it might be open for business now. UPDATE: On Tuesday, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that the Commanders are trading DE Montez Sweat to the Bears in exchange for a second-round pick."
2023,9,28,New England Patriots,2-6,"It'll be interesting if the Patriots turn into sellers at the deadline, even with injuries killing their depth almost everywhere. Some might suggest they should hold off, with winnable games against the Commanders and Colts up next, but that seems shortsighted. I'd be willing to listen to offers for Josh Uche or Kyle Dugger , the latter of whom had a huge game in Sunday's loss to Miami . It's not that they're not good players, but they're two of the few Patriots assets that could net something in return, and it's not likely both will receive big extensions from New England in 2024. One would assume there's another stripdown coming, although it's hard to imagine what the offseason plan will be. The optimism sparked by the Bills win was short-lived, and reality has set back in."
2023,9,29,Chicago Bears,2-6,"One thing you can't do is blame Tyson Bagent for Sunday's loss . You could see his wheels spinning a bit out there as the Chargers' pass rush bore down on him, but the kid held up well. He's not the problem. There is more than one of those, but let's start with the pass rush on the Bears' side. I've mentioned it once or twice, but this group just isn't getting it done. Justin Herbert had been under fire in recent games, but on Sunday, he was sitting back in a rocking chair throwing darts. Only one Bear ( T.J. Edwards ) even got a mitt on Herbert, who threw 40 passes. There were other things, too. But if I am general manager Ryan Poles, I am scheming every way I can to add two impact rushers next offseason. UPDATE: On Tuesday, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that the Bears are making a move to immediately upgrade their pass rush, sending a second-round pick to the Commanders in exchange for DE Montez Sweat ."
2023,9,30,New York Giants,2-6,"A day after Tyrod Taylor left the Giants' OT loss to the Jets with a ribs injury , Daniel Jones was cleared to return . That's the one silver lining here, because the Giants have three straight road games coming up, and otherwise, Tommy DeVito might have been set to start at least the first of them. The Giants can hang their hats on a defense that has been vastly improved over the past three games, led Sunday by Kayvon Thibodeaux in a massive performance . He's helped energize the pass rush, but that's a group whose effectiveness will suddenly be questioned in light of the Leonard Williams trade . It's not shocking the Giants have become sellers, but that's a tough loss for a defense that was showing it could keep the team in games."
2023,9,31,Carolina Panthers,1-6,"The Panthers won a game , and they had to feel good about Bryce Young having arguably his best NFL outing against the Texans and C.J. Stroud , who had been the better rookie quarterback prior to Sunday. Young has shown some incremental growth and improved confidence in recent contests, even if sacks remain an issue. It wasn't obvious to the naked eye what fruit the play-calling change from Frank Reich to Thomas Brown bore, but Young did seem to be in better rhythm. All of a sudden, you look at the schedule, and there are some winnable games. Obviously, no team is likely to dig out of an 0-6 hole to make a playoff run, but the Panthers would surely be thrilled if Young could match Cam Newton's mark of six rookie victories."
2023,9,32,Arizona Cardinals,1-7,"All eyes should turn toward Kyler Murray 's potential return, whenever it comes . This is not Joshua Dobbs slander, I promise. After an icy three quarters against the Ravens , Dobbs did cook a little late and gave the Cardinals a shot. He has more than earned respect for how he's played. But Dobbs is also not awash in talent and has leveled off. Switching to rookie Clayton Tune as Murray's short-term replacement makes sense. But more than anything, the Cardinals have to get their future decision on Murray correct. Every game Murray plays gives the team a better view of the situation. Plus, he's more dynamic than Dobbs, and the marriage of Murray and Drew Petzing might be better than we imagined. The first-year play-caller has done a really nice job with the tough hand he's been dealt so far. UPDATE: On Tuesday, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported that the Cardinals are trading QB Josh Dobbs to the Vikings ."
2023,10,1,Philadelphia Eagles,8-1,"Philadelphia remains the class of the NFC -- and, for now, the league. Sunday's nail-biter win might have paved the road to the No. 1 seed in the conference and the bye that comes with it, but it also highlighted the luck factor. Dak Prescott sliced up the Eagles' embattled secondary. Luke Schoonmaker 's fourth-down catch in the fourth quarter was inches from being a touchdown. Dallas scored on the subsequent drive, but Prescott's foot was out of bounds by about the same distance on a two-point conversion attempt. Philly fumbled three times and recovered the ball each time, including when D'Andre Swift coughed it up with a minute left . It felt like Dallas outplayed the Eagles over the course of 60 minutes, but Philly finished more effectively than the Cowboys -- an area where the Eagles have been better than Dallas all season. Perhaps that intangible skill is the their superpower."
2023,10,2,Baltimore Ravens,7-2,"Much of the buzz around this team surrounds Lamar Jackson , and there's little mystery as to why. But the defense deserves heaps of praise, too. Baltimore now leads the NFL in points allowed (13.8 points per game), ranks second in yards per game allowed (262.6) and is third in sack percentage (9.4%). Any time you can rack up four sacks and hold a quality opponent to six first downs and three points, you've dominated. The Ravens gave up 24 points to Arizona in Week 8 (with all but seven of those points coming in the final seven minutes) but have allowed only 45 points combined in the other five games since Week 3. Now they have back-to-back home games against the Browns and Bengals . Ladies and gentlemen, the AFC North race is officially on . Baltimore looks really tough to beat now."
2023,10,3,Kansas City Chiefs,7-2,"Sunday provided proof that Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce don't need to have their greatest games for the Chiefs to have a chance to win. This defense will give up some rushing yards and has snagged just five interceptions, but those are about the only bad things you can say about this unit. The 2019 and 2021 defenses finished seventh and eighth in the NFL, respectively, in points allowed. This year's group is better than both of those units -- it might even be good enough to carry this team in some of the tougher games left on the schedule. I'm not sure there's a better group of tackling defensive backs in this league right now. You might catch a pass against the Chiefs, but good luck getting much YAC after that. They swarm ."
2023,10,4,Jacksonville Jaguars,6-2,"After a 1-2 start, the Jags reeled off five straight wins in five different stadiums, handling extensive travel, injuries and a short week extremely well. Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne are having terrific seasons, Doug Pederson is coaching his tail off, and the defense leads the NFL in takeaways per game. That's the good news. But the Jaguars better have rested up during their Week 9 bye, because the schedule down the stretch is a whale. They have games left against the 49ers , Texans , Bengals , Browns and Ravens , plus two vs. the Titans , who always seem to play Jacksonville tough and have been better with Will Levis at QB. The Jags remain major favorites to win the AFC South, but this slate is going to be a heck of a challenge."
2023,10,5,Detroit Lions,6-2,"The Week 9 bye allowed for some unnecessary navel gazing, especially for a team that hasn't won its division in 30 years. But seriously, look at the Lions' remaining schedule: Five of the nine games are on the road, but only four games left are against teams currently over .500. Two of those games are against the Vikings , who no longer have Kirk Cousins . One is at New Orleans , where the Saints are 2-2 after struggling in a win over Chicago. The Lions also face the 2-7 Bears twice , plus the 3-5 Broncos . Detroit capturing the NFC North isn't a fait accompli, but it's getting there. Jahmyr Gibbs breaking out in their last game was a massive development, as he and the soon-to-return David Montgomery could be very important come playoff time."
2023,10,6,Miami Dolphins,6-3,"Falling to the Bills , Eagles and Chiefs -- all outside of Miami -- brings no shame, but it's true that the Dolphins haven't beaten a quality team yet. That said, the loss to Kansas City in Germany wasn't a lost cause; the defense arguably played its best game, and the rushing attack showed signs of life despite the absence of De'Von Achane . Jalen Ramsey now has two games with this team under his belt, and the Week 9 returns of CB Xavien Howard and S Jevon Holland helped Miami hold the Chiefs to 67 second-half yards and Travis Kelce to his lowest receiving output in a game since 2018. If the offense can regain its firepower after the bye, the Dolphins will have a chance to change the can't-beat-a-good-team narrative down the stretch. Currently, five of their eight remaining games are against opponents who are .500 or better."
2023,10,7,San Francisco 49ers,5-3,"The Week 9 bye provided a soft landing after a three-game losing streak, and it also helped give me some perspective on this team. The sky isn't falling, I suspect. Even taking into account all the issues that cropped up over the past month, there is still a path for the 49ers to get to the Super Bowl. Brock Purdy was playing at an MVP level before his three-game struggles, and with the eventual returns of Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams (who each missed the past two contests), Purdy can return to that level. The defense, which has struggled to pressure or cover consistently of late, also has help arriving in the form of trade acquisition Chase Young . The schedule remains thorny, but six of the Niners' remaining nine games come against teams currently below them on this list."
2023,10,8,Dallas Cowboys,5-3,"A few inches here, a foot out of bounds there, a fumble taking an unlucky bounce ... The Cowboys cruelly lost a game they absolutely could have -- and probably should have -- won in Philadelphia, and I just couldn't kill them for that. But should I? The question is whether you think coming up just short on some of these critical plays is a chronic issue or not. The Week 3 loss to Arizona screams YES , with all the red-zone failures. Sunday qualifies as further evidence there's a problem. Yet, the 'Boys have shown the ability to bludgeon so-so teams and outplayed the Chargers in crunch time. It's unclear. I'm not bailing on Dallas now -- not after the defense clamped down late and Dak Prescott made some big plays. But I am worried in the long run."
2023,10,9,Cincinnati Bengals,5-3,"Joe Burrow is not only back, he's now in the MVP race . His early-season struggles and calf injury are distant memories now, as he showed in the 24-18 win over Buffalo that the Bengals can win without big nights from Ja'Marr Chase and Joe Mixon , both of whom had been significant producers in Cincinnati's recent turnaround. Tee Higgins also has reasserted himself after a string of forgettable performances, and the tight ends made a surprisingly sizable contribution -- another sign the team has added offensive dimensions. The Bengals' defense really held firm after allowing the first-drive TD. This is a dangerous club now, even if the remaining schedule really is a murderers' row. I think it'll only make them stronger in the long run."
2023,10,10,Cleveland Browns,5-3,"The Browns had five scoring marches against Arizona , but the starting field positions on the TD drives were the Arizona 49-yard line, the Arizona 11 and the Cleveland 44. That final drive featured a 49-yard dime from Deshaun Watson to Amari Cooper ; earlier, they connected for 59 . Those two passes represented nearly half of Watson's passing yards Sunday, but they're the plays that provide hope this air attack can elevate, with the playoffs now clearly in sight. The AFC North is an absolute bear, with every team two-plus games over .500 and each possessing a good defense. The Browns know their passing game will be put to the test these next two weeks ( at Baltimore , vs. Steelers ). It's as good a time as any to prove they can throw to win."
2023,10,11,Buffalo Bills,5-4,"You can convince yourself that Sunday's loss was simply a Bengals problem; it was clear last season Cincinnati had an edge against this Bills team, and perhaps that edge just carried over. But Buffalo is now 5-4, and the offense has arguably had as many issues as the defense, at least relative to expectation. The Bills put together an impressive 85-yard TD drive on their first possession, then gained just 108 yards in their next six drives. The offensive line wasn't really an issue. The offensive personnel appears to be in decent shape. But the up-tempo pace and some of the four-wide formations they seemingly flourished with against Tampa were nowhere to be found against the Bengals. Can they secure five more victories somewhere against a really tough remaining schedule?"
2023,10,12,Seattle Seahawks,5-3,"Things looked fine for a bit in Baltimore , and then the avalanche hit. The Ravens even gave the Seahawks two fumbles in the first half, but Seattle scored zero points off the turnovers, with Geno Smith fumbling the second possession right back to Baltimore. It's getting harder to look past Smith's scuffles, as he's now logged eight turnovers in his past four starts. It's certainly not all on him; his offensive line struggled, and Seattle's defense produced plenty of face-palm plays, jumping offsides on fourth-and-1 and missing umpteen tackles. But to me, Smith's cold snap cracks the door on a discussion of whether Pete Carroll might have to consider going to Drew Lock at some point. We're not there yet -- the next two are winnable. However, a daunting 49ers - Cowboys - 49ers - Eagles cluster awaits between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
2023,10,13,New Orleans Saints,5-4,"The Saints continued one impressive streak and ended one bad one in Sunday's victory . Thanks to five Bears turnovers (three in the fourth quarter), New Orleans has now forced at least one turnover in each game this season. The Saints also ended a three-game turnover skid on offense, logging a clean sheet vs. Chicago. There just seems to be something missing with this team, given that it won the turnover battle 5-0 (5-1, if you count turnovers on downs) and still had to hang on late to win. The run defense struggled for a second week in a row and now faces swashbuckling Joshua Dobbs at Minnesota before the bye. Offensively, the Saints still seem to lack a true identity, but they've leaned in harder on the Taysom Hill package lately. Is this enough to take the NFC South? Maybe, but they still feel middling."
2023,10,14,Pittsburgh Steelers,5-3,"The Steelers are 12-5 over the past calendar year but have only outscored opponents by nine points in that span. The point differential this season along is minus-30. Pittsburgh's 5-3 record paints a picture of a very good coach (Mike Tomlin) massaging enough games to keep the team close and win some late. But in order to make any postseason noise, this offense must awaken prior to the fourth quarter. The Steelers are being out-rushed by more than 40 yards per game and out-passed by more than 50, and the offense's early-game sputtering is a big reason why. There's hope, with the emergence of Jaylen Warren , Broderick Jones and Diontae Johnson , plus the expected return of Pat Freiermuth , but everything ultimately rests on Kenny Pickett and Matt Canada improving down the stretch."
2023,10,15,Houston Texans,4-4,"I regret not having the foresight to have claimed Bucs-Texans for our ""What We Learned"" assignments , so I missed it live. Watching the TV replay put me all in my feelings. Sunday had to be surreal for Texans fans, seeing C.J. Stroud shatter rookie passing marks , while the beloved Dare Ogunbowale earned his own unique place in history as a kicker. Sure, the Texans tripped over the garden hose at Carolina in Week 8 , but this season already has been a massive, revitalizing success. Houston can make a legitimate stab at the postseason, with most remaining games looking like true toss-ups. Whether they get in or not, the Texans are big winners, because they have Stroud, Will Anderson Jr. , Tank Dell and other members of a young, emerging nucleus of talent. To think, many thought losing the No. 1 pick in Week 18 last season was disastrous. The Texans are doing just fine for themselves, thank you very much."
2023,10,16,Los Angeles Chargers,4-4,"Forget for a moment that the Chargers roundly struggled to move the ball against a good Jets defense, having even more trouble than they experienced against the Cowboys . But when the special teams can deliver a punt-return TD and two field goals, and the defense can keep the opponent out of the end zone all game, well, all is forgiven for now. The Bolts at least were opportunistic offensively, turning three turnovers into 10 points and taking advantage of some short fields. But other than that, this puppy was all on a defense that has taken its share of beatings this season. This time, the unit delivered the punishment across the board. Even on a night when Justin Herbert couldnât get much going, Los Angeles controlled the game from start to finish."
2023,10,17,Minnesota Vikings,5-4,"Between Kevin O'Connell's coaching and Joshua Dobbs ' short-week relief work, Sunday's win ranks pretty highly on the sweetness scale. Considering everyone the Vikings didn't have going in, plus everyone they lost during the game , this was a coaching masterpiece, with Dobbs providing late heroics after some early setbacks. Thirty-one points and a road victory? Incredible stuff. The defense came up with big plays, especially in the third quarter. With a 5-4 mark and Justin Jefferson 's return looming , it's not outrageous to think about the playoffs. The Vikings have winnable games remaining against the Broncos , Bears , Raiders and Packers . But this Sunday's game against the Saints could end up being a massive one for both teams' playoff hopes. For this Kirk Cousins -less Minnesota outfit, it's wild that we're even saying that."
2023,10,18,New York Jets,4-4,"Thereâs just not much positive spin you can put on the Jetsâ offensive performance Monday against a Chargers defense which hadnât looked that good since it faced a since-fired coach (Josh McDaniels) and a fourth-round rookie making his first start ( Aidan OâConnell ). Zach Wilson had been trending in a relatively positive direction, but this game stunted that. There were impressive flashes here and there, but two early fumbles and a host of missed throws cost the Jets dearly in a home game that you have to figure they felt confident about winning coming in. But if Breece Hall or Garrett Wilson arenât creating magic, this offense has very little hope these days, especially when it allows eight sacks."
2023,10,19,Indianapolis Colts,4-5,"Sunday's win over the Panthers was a big performance for the defense, regardless of the opponent. A week after the Saints -- the Saints! -- shredded the Colts for 511 yards and 38 points, the defense cranked up the pass rush and turned in its first three-pick game of the season. Kenny Moore II 's two house calls gave one of the league's more underrated players some shine, and they provided the difference in the victory. I didn't realize how much Indianapolis' offense struggled offensively until I rewatched the game. The line looked shaky, and the Colts finished with four straight punts, not crossing midfield in the second half until the final kneeldowns. Indy has winnable games on the slate, but that kind of offensive execution isn't going to cut it."
2023,10,20,Atlanta Falcons,4-5,"The Falcons have lost five of seven games, seemingly adrift in search of an offensive identity. It's tough when switching between quarterbacks. Taylor Heinicke will get at least one more chance after his up-and-down start against the Vikings , with coach Arthur Smith saying Monday the position would be reassessed going into the Week 11 bye. Heinecke's interception tilted the game in Minnesota's favor, part of a tough second half (6-for-15 passing) for the veteran QB. The Falcons moved the ball but settled for four field goals early. Bijan Robinson is apparently a part-time back now, sharing time with Tyler Allgeier . And the defense allowed 31 points to Jaren Hall and Joshua Dobbs . Their road to the playoffs could end up hinging on the two remaining games against the Saints, a team that has had Atlanta's number for years now."
2023,10,21,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,3-5,"Just as the Bucs' passing game got cooking downfield vs. Houston on Sunday , their defense, which is typically very good, was flambÃ©ed. That this happened against the best rookie quarterback in the NFL will be of little solace for a Tampa team that lost its third straight one-score game and can't seem to get all three units flowing simultaneously. Tampa played all two- and three-deep looks and tried to force C.J. Stroud to check down. Instead, Stroud carved up the Bucs' zones relentlessly. The pass rush got home a few times, but Stroud seemed unfazed by it. So many good things came out of this game -- including quality outings from Baker Mayfield , Rachaad White and Cade Otton -- but the defense just had a bad day at the office."
2023,10,22,Tennessee Titans,3-5,"Will Levis deserved more praise than shame for last Thursday's loss to the Steelers . Levis' inaccurate throws late, along with some missed opportunities prior to that, hurt the Titans' chances of winning. But he mostly outplayed counterpart Kenny Pickett despite having only a few days to prepare for his second NFL start. If Levis can continue displaying starter-caliber traits and impressive consistency, he'll have the inside track as the de facto 2024 QB1. The Titans are projected to be flush with salary-cap space; having a second-round QB under center would be more appealing than shopping for a veteran or drafting another prospect. As long as Mike Vrabel is coaching and Tennessee isn't mathematically eliminated, this team will keep fighting, and the added pressure of a tough remaining schedule can only help clarify Levis' evaluation."
2023,10,23,Green Bay Packers,3-5,"Green Bay took baby steps on offense in the win over the Rams , as the run game was strong, and some of the Packers' young playmakers got in on the fun a bit. Jordan Love not turning the ball over was another clear positive. Still, there's only so much enthusiasm Green Bay can take away from this game, which featured too many empty possessions, including a missed field-goal try, two fumbles and a three-and-out (moving backward) after turning the Rams over on downs near midfield. There were also too many offensive penalties, mostly the result of apparent mental errors. The execution was not at all gorgeous, and it was a bit too close a game against a backup QB. The schedule stiffens significantly, so cleaning those errors up is essential."
2023,10,24,Denver Broncos,3-5,"Two wins before the Week 9 bye have changed the Broncos' vector dramatically, and that's thanks largely to the defense. Yes, the same unit that was humiliated by the Dolphins . The same group that gave up 28 and 31 points to the Bears and Jets , respectively. Since then, though, Denver allowed the Chiefs to score 28 points in eight quarters and held the Packers to 17 in four. There have been personnel changes in the secondary and up front, with Fabian Moreau , Ja'Quan McMillian , Jonathon Cooper and Nik Bonitto thriving in expanded roles, and multiple injured players returning after missing the toughest stretches of the season. Could the Broncos go to Buffalo and give a suddenly struggling Bills team some fits next Monday ? You can't rule it out."
2023,10,25,Las Vegas Raiders,4-5,"The Raiders deserved some good fortune after the Josh McDaniels situation . Sunday was a solid day for Aidan O'Connell , the quarterback McDaniels apparently didn't want to use , and I'm interested in seeing more of him. The overall vibe of the Raiders just seemed much better . Even with some poor run tackling, Las Vegas played well defensively, didn't turn the ball over on offense and didn't allow a sack (while posting eight itself). Hard to top that in terms of a positive debut for interim coach Antonio Pierce. Coaching changes can sometimes spur immediate results (just ask the Raiders, who lost to the Jeff Saturday-led Colts in his debut last year ) before the momentum peters out. Or sometimes, a Rich Bisaccia or Steve Wilks can lead a sustained, inspired effort. The Raiders are not buried at 4-5."
2023,10,26,Washington Commanders,4-5,"Any talk of replacing Sam Howell has rightly dissipated, as he's now strung together two more impressive games, on top of the ones he stacked earlier in the year. Who knows how the rest of the season will go? Either way, he should be considered the guy from here on out. Even though Howell is good for at least one regrettable play per game, he's shown the kind of composure and dual-threat ability at least a dozen other teams (including the Patriots, whom he vanquished Sunday ) would love to have at the QB position right now. The Commanders' defense also deserves a back pat for turning in a strong team effort after losing its two top pass rushers. Credit to the replacements. There wasn't a massive drop-off in Washington's first game without Montez Sweat and Chase Young ."
2023,10,27,Los Angeles Rams,3-6,"If Matthew Stafford misses more time , it's hard to see a path for this team pulling itself out its three-game skid after the Week 10 bye. The good news is that they'll have additional time to potentially try adding to the QB room. Brett Rypien has completed less than half his passes and averaged 4.5 yards per attempt in two relief appearances for Stafford. He also lost a big fumble early in Sunday's loss to the Packers. It's hard to sustain drives with that kind of QB production in an offense predicated on getting the ball to Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua downfield. Both were quieted by a young Green Bay secondary. Credit the Rams' plucky but undermanned defense for keeping the game close on the road, but the team's limitations without a healthy No. 9 are just too glaring right now. EDITOR'S UPDATE: The team is expected to add veteran QB Carson Wentz , while Rypien has been waived."
2023,10,28,Chicago Bears,2-7,"If Sunday was the last we'll be seeing of Tyson Bagent for a minute, it was a tough way to go out. Any honest Bears fan would say that Bagent had acquitted himself quite well prior to the loss to the Saints , and really, that narrative held up for three quarters against New Orleans, too. That's how quickly things can change. Bagent's three fourth-quarter turnovers -- all committed while the Bears were within one score -- ended any chance of a road comeback. Justin Fields might have a chance to play when Chicago hosts the Panthers on Thursday Night Football . You want to see as much of Fields as possible going forward, with his future possibly hitting a fork in the road this offseason. At 2-7, that should be the whole focus of the backstretch."
2023,10,29,New England Patriots,2-7,"Bill Belichick having to answer near-weekly questions about his job status will never not be weird for me. The Patriots' ship sailed so straightly for so long, the fact that it's been adrift for a few years now has just been so strange. There's little mystery to New England's troubles, with quarterback Mac Jones being a talent-dependent game manager on a mostly talent-bereft team. The weaknesses are not just at the skill positions, but that's part of it. And thanks to the Patriots' gross rash of injuries on defense, that group is a very un-Belichickian shell of itself. The whole thing feels unstable and untenable. Even with the news last month of Belichick's offseason extension , nothing about his future in New England feels certain. That probably applies to Jones, too."
2023,10,30,New York Giants,2-7,"With Daniel Jones ' ACL tear coming in a loss to a team led by an interim head coach and rookie QB, the Giants' nightmare season has darkened even further than might have seemed possible. With Jones out indefinitely and Tyrod Taylor on injured reserve , Tommy DeVito overcame some rough early moments to put forward a respectable effort, and the run blocking helped spring Saquon Barkley to his best rushing average (5.6) of the season. But it's tough to summon too much excitement, with injuries crushing any hope of offensive growth and the reality of a high draft pick incoming. Sunday felt like the first time you could fairly have a conversation about the future under center, with Jones' long-term health clouding the picture and some tempting QB prospects possibly being within reach come April."
2023,10,31,Carolina Panthers,1-7,"In the span of a week, the narrative around Bryce Young has flipped again. The Week 8 win over the Texans (and OROY favorite C.J. Stroud ) was a big accomplishment, and it was Young's personal high-water mark. But everything that happened in the loss to Indianapolis on Sunday seemingly undercut that, to the point where some of us are again debating whether Young was the right pick at No. 1 overall. It didn't help that Stroud had a career game Sunday, but this was more about Young's struggles. The Panthers scored 13 points, and Young gave up 14 on two pick- sixes . On 43 dropbacks, Carolina netted 137 pass yards. On 28 runs, the Panthers gained 138. Now is the problem clear? The Young debate can't realistically be settled for a few years, but losing a potential top-five pick in 2024 adds some salt and vinegar to Carolina's wounds."
2023,10,32,Arizona Cardinals,1-8,"Jonathan Gannon, who has had his team ready to play most weeks, looked helpless at the sight of Clayton Tune being overwhelmed by Cleveland's defense . Help is on the way with Kyler Murray , who could have up to eight games -- with the next three indoors -- to prove himself as the 2024 starter, assuming he's cleared to play soon. Winning and losing is less material, given the 1-8 start; having Murray run Drew Petzing's offense extensively will be important for the long term. But there's a catch: Petzing must find a way to scheme up better blocking. Arizona's O-line was completely dominated against Cleveland, and Murray must stay healthy."
2023,11,1,Philadelphia Eagles,8-1,"Jalen Hurts admitted that the Week 10 bye came at the right time , and you hope he and his left knee got some proper rest. The Eagles' next five games could be as tough a stretch as any that a contender will face this season. They're at Kansas City in Week 11 , followed by two challenging contests at home (vs. Buffalo and San Francisco ), and then road games at Dallas and Seattle . Philadelphia is 8-1, but it will be surprising if the team doesn't drop at least one game in that gauntlet. A 3-2 mark would be very respectable. The beleaguered pass defense will get a serious test during this next month; we should find out if this is the team's Achilles' heel, or if it's something the Eagles can overcome with their pass rush and/or an offense that was starting to cook before the break."
2023,11,2,Kansas City Chiefs,7-2,"Through nine games, the Chiefs are in the same spot as they were a season ago, when they'd eventually go on to win the Super Bowl: 7-2 and atop the AFC . Even the point differentials (plus-64 through nine games last year, plus-65 this year) are nearly identical. Does it feel that way, though? Perhaps it's the way they're winning games -- without scoring as many points -- that's throwing us off. Patrick Mahomes isn't a worse quarterback, and Travis Kelce isn't a worse tight end, but the defense certainly is better. The Ravens' loss had to be a nice little bye-week surprise, helping the Chiefs' chances of earning the top playoff spot. They have four very winnable road games remaining, but tougher tests at home. The path to the AFC's top seed begins now."
2023,11,3,Baltimore Ravens,7-3,"The 2-0 Ravens moved up to No. 7 in the Week 3 Power Rankings , then lost at home to a Colts team led by its backup QB. The 3-1 Ravens sat at No. 8 following a dominant Week 4 victory in Cleveland, then blew a 10-point lead at Pittsburgh the next week. And here we are again, with Baltimore losing to the Browns on Sunday -- blowing a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead -- after climbing all the way to No. 2 in the Week 10 rankings . I briefly considered putting the Ravens at No. 1 last week. Not now, of course. They have all the ingredients -- coaching, a balanced roster and Lamar Jackson -- to be a title contender. I'm not backing off my midseason prediction that they'll make the Super Bowl. But games such as Sunday's don't help in the trust department. Teams that can't tackle always scare me more. Throw in the injuries that Marlon Humphrey and Ronnie Stanley suffered , and it was a very humbling day."
2023,11,4,Detroit Lions,7-2,"Let's talk about the offensive line. It's admittedly difficult to incorporate significant OL analysis here weekly, mostly for space reasons. But units that dominate like the Lions' O-line did on Sunday deserve the ink. Starters Taylor Decker , Jonah Jackson , Frank Ragnow , Graham Glasgow and Penei Sewell played every snap and turned in a nearly clean sheet; Detroit allowed zero sacks and eight pressures total on 33 Jared Goff dropbacks. RBs David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs averaged 7.4 yards per carry and scored TDs of 1, 1 and 75 yards between them. Short-yardage, long-yardage -- it didn't matter. Outside of one Decker penalty wiping out a TD on the Lions' first possession and a goal-line stop in the second quarter, this unit dominated a good Chargers front for 60 minutes. And it's why I believe Detroit will be an extremely tough playoff out if the defense gets back in order."
2023,11,5,San Francisco 49ers,6-3,"Boy, the Week 10 victory checked off just about every box we could dream up after the three-game losing streak preceding the Week 9 bye. Is the pass rush back? Oh yeah. Did we see the good version of Brock Purdy ? No doubt. Kyle Shanahan? In his bag. Hard to ask for much more than that in one game. Beating the Jaguars 34-3 isn't as significant, positionally, as a divisional win would be, but it was a statement victory -- which easily could have been even more lopsided -- over a quality opponent on the road. It stanched the bleeding, calmed the hysterics and served as a springboard into Niners November. San Francisco has now won seven straight November games, and throwing out the injury-riddled 2020 season, this team has dominated the colder months in the Shanahan era. The 49ers' final sprint lies ahead, but they're on the move."
2023,11,6,Miami Dolphins,6-3,"The post-bye schedule lays out nicely prior to the closing trio of games against Dallas , Baltimore and Buffalo . The Dolphins' next five matchups come teams that are .500 or worse. They have five more home games and three on the road, with only the Ravens in Week 17 looking like a stiff test among those away dates. The critics who say Miami hasn't beaten anyone good might not be quelled -- at least, not until December. But I doubt this team minds the stigma for now. With De'Von Achane on the way back and reinforcements already having returned on the offensive line, the Dolphins should go on a run here. Just in time for the start of midseason Hard Knocks , too, which is nice. There are obvious pitfalls, such as the prospect of playing without Tua Tagovailoa or Tyreek Hill should either be injured, but this team is too talented to clunk its way through eminently winnable contests."
2023,11,7,Dallas Cowboys,6-3,"If you ask me who's the best team in the NFL, I'll say it's the Cowboys (in the first half) at AT&T Stadium. In fact, I briefly mulled ranking 33 teams and listing ""Cowboys (in the first half) at AT&T Stadium"" at No. 1, but neither my editors nor you deserve that. Including Sunday's shellacking of the Giants , Dallas has outscored opponents 107-22 in home first halves (after halftime, the team has been fine ). Whatever the reason, the 'Boys have so much more mojo at home, where they've now won their last 12 games. The problem? Dallas has work to do before thinking about home playoff games. But Dak Prescott , CeeDee Lamb and the passing game are humming right now, and Sunday was great for the run game, which pounded away at a tired Giants defense."
2023,11,8,Jacksonville Jaguars,6-3,"After rising to unseen Power Rankings heights last week , the Jags fell hard and fast. Losing to the 49ers brings no shame by itself, but Jacksonville was truly clocked -- and it could have been worse. Home losses this big prompt us to question everything about a contender's credentials. That said, recent playoff teams have been on this side of the fence: Minnesota was stomped at home by Dallas last year, yet hosted a playoff game, and the 2020 Bucs were smashed at home by the Saints, but that season ended fairly well for them. So there's encouraging historical precedent. Still, on a day when the defense just wasn't getting it done, it would have been good for the offense to rise to the occasion. Jacksonville will need more going forward from Trevor Lawrence , Calvin Ridley and about a dozen other offensive players."
2023,11,9,Cleveland Browns,6-3,"The Browns can absolutely win the North. They are 6-3, half a game back of Baltimore now, and don't have an outrageous schedule left. But their chances have as much to do with Deshaun Watson as anything else. Sunday was Watson's finest hour as a Brown: He rallied his team back from a two-touchdown, fourth-quarter deficit, overcoming his own rough start (6-for-20 passing with a pick-six in the first half). In the second half, Watson completed all 14 of his passes for 134 yards and a touchdown. That Watson did it with a hurt ankle and without his two starting tackles is meaningful. If anyone had any questions about his toughness or resilience, those have been answered for now. This team has just found ways to win this season, sometimes without great QB play -- but now Watson is helping, too. EDITOR'S UPDATE: The Browns will have to move forward without their QB1. The team announced on Wednesday that Watson will undergo season-ending surgery on his right shoulder."
2023,11,10,Houston Texans,5-4,"That was nothing short of an incredible showing from the Texans' offense and QB C.J. Stroud , who not only is the massive Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite but perhaps has thrown his hat into the MVP ring . Stroud once again showed rare rookie poise and tremendous ball placement. Fellow rookie Tank Dell has become a real weapon. And veteran Noah Brown suddenly has back-to-back 150-yard receiving games. But we need to talk about the run game, which produced in a way we've not otherwise seen this season. New feature back Devin Singletary isn't a game breaker, but he kept churning away in a 30-carry, 150-yard performance that allowed Houston to control the ball for 17 of the 30 second-half minutes. Credit, too, to the Texans' offensive line for keeping Stroud clean and consistently opening holes against a dangerous Bengals front."
2023,11,11,Seattle Seahawks,6-3,"There were some plays throughout the game against Washington that showed the bad side of Geno Smith âs season, which has been marked by regression after a terrific 2022 campaign. Smith left yards and points on the field, struggled on third downs and was hearing the Seattle fansâ disappointment, but he summoned some late magic in leading the Seahawks to the go-ahead TD and game-winning field goal in the fourth quarter. On top of that, Smith threw for a career-high 369 yards and had his first turnover-free game in his past five outings. That right there, along with a big Kenneth Walker III game, is Seattleâs formula for victory, even if it came against a weary Washington defense. The Seahawksâ defense certainly could firm up a bit, but they'll take a win they absolutely needed."
2023,11,12,Cincinnati Bengals,5-4,"Even taking into account all the recent positive vibes around this team, Thursday's upcoming game at Baltimore suddenly shapes up as a near must-win contest if the Bengals harbor any hopes of claiming a third straight AFC North title. The Ravens' loss to Cleveland on Sunday created an opportunity to gain ground, but Cincinnati couldn't take care of business against the impressive Texans. The Bengals are now 5-4 overall and 0-2 in the division -- the deck they shuffled is already stacked against them. Lamar Jackson has been a thorn in Cincinnati's side for years now, and the Bengals already lost to the Ravens once this season . The defense can't afford to have another day like it did Sunday against Houston -- arguably the unit's worst performance in a few years -- in Week 11, or the whole thing could fall apart again."
2023,11,13,Pittsburgh Steelers,6-3,"Another defender lost to injury , more passing-game disappointment -- and another victory . It's stupendous, really. The Steelers have mastered the rope-a-dope art of winning with minimal style points and shocking efficiency. Here's a more positive spin: The Steelers know when to make big plays. They've only outscored opponents in one quarter this season, but it's the key one: the fourth. And while they yield plenty of yards on defense -- Green Bay had eight plays of 20-plus yards Sunday -- the Steelers are strong in departments that mean more: sacks, takeaways and points allowed. In almost every single victory, the defense had to shut the door late. It's hard to question a team that consistently shows it can win close games, but how far can this approach really take Pittsburgh?"
2023,11,14,Buffalo Bills,5-5,"Four turnovers, or five if you count the third-quarter turnover on downs. A defense that spent 37-plus minutes on the field. Two back-breaking penalties in the final 35 seconds. And that, kids, is how the Bills lost to the Broncos on Monday night. That's a fourth defeat in the last six weeks, dropping Buffalo to a shocking .500 record. What do you do with this team? Josh Allen did his usual goat-turned-hero thing, but the early missed opportunities -- and too much time left on the clock -- came back to bite Buffalo. Digging out of holes is no way to live on a weekly basis. When I alluded to the idea of the Bills missing the playoffs last week, it still felt like they'd get things straightened out, but now it's in real doubt. They still have to weather the Jets at home and go to Philly before the badly needed bye."
2023,11,15,Minnesota Vikings,6-4,"If nothing else, this is clear: Joshua Dobbs can play in this league, and Kevin OâConnell can coach a little. This season has gone nothing like the 2022 campaign did, and yet, the Vikings are right back in contention. After Sunday's triumph over New Orleans , theyâve won five straight -- the longest active win streak in the league -- despite starting three different quarterbacks in the last three games. That shouldnât be a problem going forward, assuming Dobbs stays healthy, because heâs the man. I openly called for a change in Arizona because things went stale there after a certain point with Dobbs, but heâs rediscovered his mojo and is in a better situation, especially with Justin Jefferson approaching a return . Oh, and how about that Minnesota defense? It is allowing 297.9 yards per game since Week 4 and has 11 turnovers in the past five contests, including two huge ones against the Saints in the final three-plus minutes."
2023,11,16,New Orleans Saints,5-5,"Derek Carr âs shoulder might be OK , but that doesn't mean the Saints came out healthy after the loss to the Vikings . Both CB Marshon Lattimore and WR Michael Thomas suffered injuries that could sting a bit, so the bye seems to have come at a fairly opportune time. Remember, weâre talking about a division leader here, despite the 5-5 record. It might be harder to not win the South at this point. The Saints have the easiest schedule left by opponentsâ win percentage, with only one remaining foe currently owning more than four wins, and four of their remaining seven games are at home, including three straight in December. But if the defense keeps sliding, it could open the door for Tampa Bay and/or Atlanta. The Saints couldnât stop Joshua Dobbs and T.J. Hockenson , and they didn't generate a single takeaway at Minnesota on Sunday."
2023,11,17,Indianapolis Colts,5-5,"Theyâve stepped into the bye on a mini high, winning two straight after a rough patch to get back to .500. Technically, every team remaining on their schedule is in contention, but right now, the 6-3 Steelers have the best record among those foes. The Week 14 road game at Cincinnati will be a challenge, too, with the Bengals barely ahead of them in the playoff standings . Strangely, the Colts are now 4-1 on the road after the sausage grinder of a win in Frankfurt, but only 1-4 at Lucas Oil Stadium. That latter record will have to improve if Indianapolis is serious about making a playoff push, as four of the Coltsâ final seven games are at home. The defense and Gardner Minshew limit this teamâs chances, but it should get healthier this week to be ready for the stretch run."
2023,11,18,Los Angeles Chargers,4-5,"Not sure if the lose-two, win-two pace will keep up all season, but the Chargers followed their most recent pair of victories with a defensive nightmare that landed them back in the loss column , so some things are repeating. Even a brilliant Justin Herbert performance wasn't enough against the Lions. The defensive showing was even worse than what the Bolts displayed during the pounding Miami laid on them in Week 1 at home. Speaking of, the Chargers are suddenly 2-3 in Inglewood, with the two victories coming against the Bears and Raiders . The four remaining road games are winnable. The four home games all could be tough ones, including a prime-time matchup against the Ravens and the regular-season finale against the Chiefs . The 4-5 Chargers have five teams to pass in the playoff standings , and they're only 2-3 so far vs. AFC foes. They're not dead yet, but they've got to get going very soon."
2023,11,19,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,4-5,"After four respectable but heartbreaking losses in a row, the Buccaneers ended the streak and kept themselves in the NFC South race. Truthfully, losing on Sunday wouldn't have put them out of it. That's just the way the South is -- again. For all the jokes about that division, the Bucs loom as a sneaky-good team to me. They're not great, and they're not a realistic title contender, but they could shock someone in the right setting. That's what the defense's performance told me against Tennessee, anyway. Tampa made a ton of plays in the backfield, stopped Derrick Henry in his tracks, held twice in the red zone and topped it all off with a late pick. Baker Mayfield seemed to be pressing in other games, but I didn't sense that in this one. When the defense plays at this level, it really seems to calm the offensive approach a bit."
2023,11,20,Denver Broncos,4-5,"I'm going to start with an apology. Vance Joseph, I'm sorry. I underestimated you and your defense. In my defense, things were looking a little rough early. But boy, since the first Kansas City game , the effort's been pretty terrific, even with the late TD drive allowed Monday. Lemme also shout out Russell Wilson , who hasn't always had it easy (or made it easy for himself) in Denver. But Monday was strong, as the 34-year-old delivered some clutch throws at winning time -- including a few clever flip passes under duress -- to sting the Bills' defense on the two late scoring drives. There were two three-and-outs and a fumble in the second half, so the offense remains an unfinished project. But even two botched extra points somehow didn't prevent a second straight statement victory over a quality foe ."
2023,11,21,Las Vegas Raiders,5-5,"Antonio Pierce followed his smashing debut in Week 9 with an emotional Week 10 victory spearheaded by one of the interim coach's favorite players. No, not the great Maxx Crosby , who was held sack-less but did get some shots in on Jets QB Zach Wilson . Robert Spillane was the player NBC's Cris Collinsworth was buzzing about, sharing how Pierce planned to build around Spillane. Even as smart and as tough as Spillane is, that sentiment caught me off guard. But what first sounded like coachspeak soon echoed like scripture. Spillane was everywhere -- and he capped off the night with a game-changing interception in the final minutes. Now the Raiders are 2-0 with their new coach and back in contention at 5-5. Wild stuff."
2023,11,22,New York Jets,4-5,"The criticism Zach Wilson received for his late interception against the Raiders was warranted. It was a poor decision and throw, and it ended the Jetsâ best chance to take the lead late. The lack of offensive progress has been disappointing, but Wilson has made strides, even if the red-zone struggles and late-game mistakes are a big part of his story. He is taking fewer sacks, cutting back on turnovers, using his legs more and starting to gain confidence with big throws. He helped deliver the Eaglesâ only loss . Wilson also played well against the Chiefs , with only the late giveaway (sound familiar?) marring his performance. Another problem is that the Jets arenât disciplined around Wilson. C.J. Uzomah had two penalties in Sunday's loss , including one that called back a TD, and the Jets had eight total (seven on offense). That part gets put to the side too often."
2023,11,23,Washington Commanders,4-6,"Near the start of both halves, Sam Howell twice did this Mahomesian thing where he scrambled to his left, sort of inviting the defenders to converge on him, before flipping the ball to Brian Robinson for long gains. The first went for a 51-yard TD , the second gained 48 yards . They might have something there. Howell's had a few rough games but mostly has stood tall in the face of adversity, leading two game-tying drives in Sunday's fourth quarter, albeit in another loss . Clearly, the talk about benching Howell at one point was utterly silly. Right now, he and some of the skill-position players are the best thing Washington has going for itself. The question now is whether this coaching staff is doing enough to convince new owner Josh Harris to keep the group in place -- and consequently, whether Howell will get to continue working in this system or be forced to learn a new one."
2023,11,24,Atlanta Falcons,4-6,"Arthur Smith appears to be in a very awkward spot right now with his quarterbacks. He said he didn't want ""to play musical chairs "" with them and, I assume, face the accompanying weekly questions. It's possible that Taylor Heinicke 's hamstring injury and poor play Sunday (coming off a so-so game against the Vikings ) made Smith's decision for him. At the very least, it opens up the door for a switch back to Desmond Ridder , who looked more poised in relief on Sunday, leading a go-ahead drive before Arizona won it in the final moments. The Falcons gave Bijan Robinson plenty of touches, and he was great. But what happened to the defense? Kyler Murray carved it up late. One step forward, two back -- a common theme for this season in Atlanta."
2023,11,25,Tennessee Titans,3-6,"It feels like Will Levis ' fine debut happened months ago. To be fair to the rookie quarterback, much of Sunday's disappointing offensive showing had nothing to do with Levis himself; the Titans just aren't a well-oiled group right now on that side of the ball. Pass protection and inconsistent run-blocking remain major issues. The loss to Tampa was ugly up front, and Mike Vrabel might not have many viable solutions. The red-zone execution has been bad all season, and Tennessee went 0-for-2 on Sunday despite getting inside the 10-yard line on two separate drives. The Titans have survived previous such cold snaps because the defense and special teams have been able to clean up after the offense. Not on Sunday. The blame fell mostly on an inexistent pass rush and a secondary that allowed Bucs receivers to roam with impunity."
2023,11,26,Green Bay Packers,3-6,"The most disappointing part about Jordan Love 's season has been the connection with his No. 1 receiver -- or, at least, the player we assumed would be his WR1. Christian Watson got hot last season and entered summer as the presumed alpha, but a hamstring injury sidelined him for three games. Since Watson's return, we've seen the second-year pro haul in at least one catch of significant yardage in every game, but the chemistry with Love just hasn't been there. Watson had a pair of nice grabs Sunday , but he also had a brutal third-down drop, and Love was picked off twice while throwing in Watson's direction. It took Watson time to synchronize with Aaron Rodgers , as well, but the Packers put themselves in this situation now, where many are looking for Love to show he's the guy this season -- leaving little time to mesh with Watson more gradually."
2023,11,27,Los Angeles Rams,3-6,"Matthew Stafford is set to get back in the mix against Seattle on Sunday , but with the Rams at 3-6 after losing four of their last five games, will that be enough for L.A. to make any kind of serious run at the playoffs? Well, we've seen the Rams without Stafford, so there's reason to think his return will be a big upgrade, especially when two of the team's most reliable producers, WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua , are dependent on the quarterback. Kyren Williams , meanwhile, was making hay before he was hurt -- and he could get on the field again in Week 12 against the same Arizona team he gashed for 158 yards on 20 carries in Week 6 . That's better than the 2.6 rushing yards the Rams averaged in their Week 9 loss at Green Bay. The defense has had its hands full all season, though, and the Rams are 1-3 at home, so if there's going to be improvement from within, it can't all just come via injury returnees."
2023,11,28,Chicago Bears,3-7,"To Matt Eberflus' credit, he's coaxed better football out of his team -- especially the defense he's now running -- over the past month-plus following an 0-4 start. Eberflus went 2-2 with Tyson Bagent filling in for Justin Fields , the kind of thing that might have landed him on Coach of the Year lists, had the first four games of 2023 gone better. Now comes the trick: winning with Fields. The third-year pro is trending in the right direction and could start against the Lions on Sunday, but Eberflus must figure out why the team is 4-17 on his watch with the starting quarterback starting. There's also a catch: Chicago's remaining schedule is tough, starting with roadies at Detroit and Minnesota before the Week 13 bye. Eberflus and Fields must find a way to flourish together down the stretch."
2023,11,29,Arizona Cardinals,2-8,"Thereâs only so much buzz and hope a team can generate after a 1-8 start, but Kyler Murray had no issues with that. His return required some patience from all of us, but we were rewarded with a taste of pre-injury Murray in Sunday's victory : a dazzling, imperfect playmaker who can steal a defenseâs soul. Thatâs about as tough a game as the Falcons have had defensively this season. There was rust, especially on third downs, but Murray looked to be in good form and ready to take over for the remainder of the season. If Murray looks great, and it means the Cardinals win a few games down the stretch and cost themselves draft positioning , so be it. Getting Murray back into prime form trumps a few draft slots every day, including -- and especially -- on Sundays."
2023,11,30,New England Patriots,2-8,"The cracks in the Patriotsâ armor had been showing for a few years now, and some ugly and awkward incidents late last season appeared to portend the confluence of issues in 2023. The team released promising young CB Jack Jones amid strange circumstances. Mac Jones was benched late in the Germany loss , replaced by Bailey Zappe , who made a peculiar decision on the game-ending fake-spike pick . Two active wide receivers, Ty Montgomery and Jalen Reagor , played a combined one offensive snap against the Colts. The Pats crawled into the bye, jet-lagged and star-crossed, and itâs hard to imagine a fairytale ending here. What will New England look like down the stretch? Will it be any different?"
2023,11,31,New York Giants,2-8,"They have seven more games, plus the bye week, to get through the season, and theyâre pretty much backed into starting Tommy DeVito this week at the Commanders -- and maybe beyond. Sundayâs pasting by the Cowboys came with the added sting of sideline bickering involving multiple offensive players, including Saquon Barkley . This is going to be Brian Dabollâs toughest challenge as the Giants coach so far, harder even than turning them into a contender and winning a playoff game last season. Washington and New England are two favorable opponents right now, all things considered, and the bye could help release more tension. But at the moment, after Xavier McKinney openly questioned the defensive coaches, it feels like stronger storms could hit at any time."
2023,11,32,Carolina Panthers,1-8,"Last Thursday against the Bears was technically the low point for Bryce Young and the Panthers offensively -- at least in terms of yards and first downs -- which is a bit surprising because it felt so similar to previous Carolina games, save for the one Andy Dalton started. We know this team needs more playmakers. Itâs clear the offensive line is not yet a finished product, or close to that. The run game has been sporadic. So there is plenty to consider in terms of upgrades in the offseason, including coaches. Everyone raved about Frank Reichâs staff hires last winter. Ideally, Young shows steady improvement over the next couple months -- but if he doesnât , you can bet there will be major changes around him."
2023,12,1,Philadelphia Eagles,9-1,"It was neither easy nor pretty, but the Eagles overcame a 10-point deficit to defeat the Chiefs by winning the second half in all three phases. The offense had very little going early outside of DâAndre Swift ground gains and a few shots to DeVonta Smith . But on a night when A.J. Brown had one catch and might have been responsible for Jalen Hurts â interception, Philadelphia delivered two crucial TD drives in the second half. Hurts ran them both in , while Swift and Smith again came up huge. The defense was put in a bad spot, giving up 10 points in a pre-halftime blitz, but after that, it was lights out. Twice in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs drove well into Philly territory, and twice the Eagles held them without points. And donât forget Britain Covey âs return yards, especially his 26-yarder that kick-started the third-quarter TD drive. This was a statement victory, style points be damned."
2023,12,2,Baltimore Ravens,8-3,"The Mark Andrews injury is a cruel twist of fate for a team that, in spite of Week 10's meltdown loss to Cleveland , still has looked like a Super Bowl-caliber group more often than not this season. The Pro Bowl tight end had been their rock, a steady source of production. That's gone, but Baltimore's hopes aren't. TE Isaiah Likely has been a bit of a ghost this year in the pass game (nine catches in 11 games), but he looked like an emerging weapon last season, so I am not discounting him. Plus, after Odell Beckham Jr. 's breakout game and touchdowns from Nelson Agholor and Rashod Bateman (not to mention, a Zay Flowers TD that was called back), Lamar Jackson really does have an array of pass catchers to lean on."
2023,12,3,Detroit Lions,8-2,"Jared Goff threw three picks Sunday against the Bears , though two of them were a little fluky, as one was tipped and another spawned from contact that might have been defensive pass interference . Still, Goff also had two other passes that easily could have been picked, including one that might have been a long pick-six by Chicago CB Jaylon Johnson . It felt like the Bears threw way more pressure at the Lions than expected, which threw off the rhythm of the passing game. But unlike some others, I saw this win as a positive for Detroit. Almost everything went against the Lions in this game. They were minus-three in turnovers and trailed by 12 points with less than four minutes left ... yet they found a way to win. This should be the type of game that makes us respect Detroit more ."
2023,12,4,San Francisco 49ers,7-3,"After two impressive performances, including Sunday's win over Tampa Bay , this team looks ready for a season-defining stretch from Thanksgiving through Christmas. The 49ers have a pair of games against the reeling Seahawks sandwiched around the NFC Championship Game rematch in Philly. After that, they head on the road to face a revived Cardinals team before hosting the Ravens in what could be a late-season Super Bowl preview in Santa Clara. Brock Purdy has six TDs and 11 incomplete passes over the past two games. The defense has returned to form, allowing the Jaguars and Bucs to total 508 combined yards and forcing six turnovers against them, although the season-ending injury to Talanoa Hufanga is a big one. Still, this team is humming again with its nearly annual autumn heat wave. Healthy Kyle Shanahan teams have been hard to beat in November and December."
2023,12,5,Kansas City Chiefs,7-3,"You canât turn the ball over twice in the red zone and drop umpteen passes -- each one more crushing than the last -- and expect to win against a team as good as the Eagles. The Chiefsâ defense turned in a first-class effort, even if it wore down a bit late, and Patrick Mahomes and Isiah Pacheco made enough plays. This loss is going to sting, if for no other reason than it served as a reminder that the Chiefsâ pass catchers -- even Travis Kelce on Monday -- have been a net disappointment this season. Kelce had a drop and a fumble . Justin Watson had at least three drops, including one on Mahomesâ final attempt . But if Marquez Valdes-Scantling just catches that late deep ball , perhaps none of the other miscues matter. The Chiefs were the better team on Monday until they werenât."
2023,12,6,Miami Dolphins,7-3,"The offense moved the ball Sunday but struggled to score, failing to reach the end zone in eight drives (not counting the first- and second-half enders) to close out the game. Miami had three giveaways, plus two other quasi-turnovers (missed field goal and on downs), and lost RB DeâVon Achane to injury again after just three snaps. The Dolphins also had a scare when Tyreek Hill briefly left the game, although they scored a touchdown with him in the locker room and Hill returned later. This win was more about Miamiâs defense, which forced three second-half INTs and shut out the Raiders after halftime. Jalen Ramsey has been more than advertised, picking off two deep shots from Aidan OâConnell , including the game-clincher in the end zone late."
2023,12,7,Dallas Cowboys,7-3,"This was a businesslike win over Carolina , and two home games await before the big rematch with Philadelphia (which is also at Jerry World). The trick, obviously, is to avoid a Cardinals type of loss . But the Cowboys have been so dominant in Dallas this season, they figure to have the edge over both the Commanders on Thanksgiving and the suddenly-slumping Seahawks coming in on a short week, with Geno Smith and Kenneth Walker III currently ailing. Dak Prescott is playing his best football. The pass-catching group is dangerous. Tony Pollard is humming again. The defensive front seven's had too many games with poor run fits, but the group's pressuring and covering well. There are times this looks like a Super Bowl team. We might not find out until Philly: Round 2 , with the 'Boys likely needing to win that massive showdown if they want to steal the division."
2023,12,8,Jacksonville Jaguars,7-3,"This was exactly the kind of bounce-back game you wanted to see from the Jaguars after getting mauled at home by the 49ers. And it was exactly what Trevor Lawrence and Calvin Ridley needed, too. Did you realize they entered Sunday with nine TD passes and two TD receptions, respectively? While that connection has been erratic this season, it was brilliant against the Titans . Lawrence hit Ridley on two TD passes and ran in two more scores , turning in his cleanest, most prolific game of the season. The Jaguarsâ defense also had a fine game, allowing just 82 first-half yards and not yielding a scoring drive until they were up 27-0. The 49ers game made us question Jacksonvilleâs credentials, but this victory helped answer some of those lingering worries."
2023,12,9,Cleveland Browns,7-3,"The Browns passed their first test A.D. ( After Deshaun ), although it wasn't easy, as they failed to gain more than 19 yards on a play all game, ultimately edging past the Steelers, 13-10 . Dorian Thompson-Robinson was far cleaner in this game than he was in his first start back in Week 4 , leading field goal drives at the ends of both halves, connecting on 10 passes combined over those two marches. The fifth-round rookie also ran for two first downs and for 9 yards on a 3rd-and-10. Could Cleveland use a little more from him and the passing game? Absolutely. But with an efficient ground attack and a defense that can take over games, the Browns have the look of a team no one wants to face in cold-weather months. Cleveland is improbably 7-3, and there's a clear path to the postseason ahead."
2023,12,10,Houston Texans,6-4,"C.J. Stroud threw a first-half interception , but in spite of the pressure the Cardinals were throwing at him, Stroud was generally rolling through the first three quarters, guiding the Texans on three touchdown drives of 60-plus yards. That's the level we've come to expect from the precocious rookie, who has mostly been lights out -- especially when the lights are brightest. So that's why it was so shocking to see Stroud implode in the fourth quarter, continually leaving the back door cracked open for the Cardinals to steal one. Houston's defense finished the game with three straight fourth-down stops after Arizona had crossed midfield. It was a good team victory, which will be DeMeco Ryans' bottom line here. It's good to know the Texans can survive a spell and finish off a game where Stroud briefly plays like a rookie."
2023,12,11,Buffalo Bills,6-5,"When a team takes a drastic measure, such as a midseason coordinator firing , what it can't do is come out and look worse in the very next game. Thankfully, new offensive coordinator Joe Brady's debut was a success, overseeing the Bills' most impressive offensive showing in a few games. It wasn't the potency we saw from Buffalo in Weeks 2 through 4, but very good overall, even if things warmed up slowly. The Bills certainly will take the 32-6 win over the Jets, as they're still in the playoff race at 6-5, but the upcoming schedule is no joke. The true tests will come on the road against the Eagles and Chiefs over the next two games, with a Week 13 bye in between. Win those, and Buffalo can make a real statement. But that's quite the ask from a team that hasn't won a road game since Week 3 at the Commanders . A lot has changed since then."
2023,12,12,Seattle Seahawks,6-4,"Everything since the Week 5 bye has been a struggle for Seattle, with Geno Smith getting hurt on Sunday during one of his better recent games. And unlike in Smithâs pre-bye injury game against the Giants back in Week 4, backup Drew Lock offered little help in his showing against the Rams . Then Smith returned and almost pulled off the late comeback, but you have to make your field goals . Head coach Pete Carroll is optimistic that Smith will play against the 49ers on Thursday night , which is good news, but the injury timing couldnât have been much worse on Sunday. Also poorly timed: the Seahawksâ 12 penalties for 130 yards, even if the Rams tried their best to match them. The two most painful flags came on late third-down stops: the DPI against Devon Witherspoon -- a call Carroll took issue with -- and the illegal use of hands penalty against Riq Woolen . Both gave the Rams first downs, and they scored on both drives. That's how a sneaky-big game slipped away."
2023,12,13,Pittsburgh Steelers,6-4,"The Steelers announced the firing of much-maligned offensive coordinator Matt Canada on Tuesday. Not exactly shocking news, considering Pittsburgh's well-documented offensive issues continued in a 13-10 loss to the Deshaun Watson -less Browns on Sunday. We'll see if this move jump-starts the Steelers' attack, but I still feel like the time is nigh to stop making excuses for Kenny Pickett . Yeah, yeah -- I might have been the voice of reason before, but I am slowly seeing the light of the dark side. Struggling to get much of anything going in Year 2, Pickett just hasn't been seeing it or feeling it. We all caught the complaints before Canada's firing about the offensive design doing Pickett a disservice, but that felt similar to the Mac Jones excuses we heard in chorus last season, vis-Ã -vis Matt Patricia. (How's that working out this year in New England?) Even if the young quarterbacks' situations are different, the criticism is the same: justified. The Steelers have gone 6-4, often in spite of what the passing game has done. Maybe the play-caller shakeup helps, but it seems like the problem runs deeper here. Can Jaylen Warren play QB? Winnable games lie ahead, and the playoffs are a reasonable goal, but can the Steelers actually threaten anyone if they get into the tournament?"
2023,12,14,Minnesota Vikings,6-5,"They had an opportunity to steal one in Denver, but they could only manage three points over their final four possessions, turning it over three times (INT, fumble, downs) in the final 18 minutes of the game. Joshua Dobbs had some moments early, and the run-game duo of Alexander Mattison and Ty Chandler was potent, but Mattison and Dobbs combined for three turnovers. Likewise, the defense took and gave, holding Denver to five field goals before allowing the game-winning TD drive in the final minutes. Kevin O'Connell has done a tremendous job with this team, and the Vikings remain firmly in the playoff race for now, but this was one that got away. They would have been 5-1 on the road had they pulled it off Sunday night."
2023,12,15,New Orleans Saints,5-5,"Your NFC South leaders are a curious lot. On paper, the Saints look pretty good -- and maybe the most likely team to finish first. But they're also surprisingly underwhelming compared to other contenders. New Orleans' wins have come against Ryan Tannehill (injured/benched), Bryce Young (struggling rookie), Mac Jones ( benched? benchable?), Gardner Minshew (backup/lower-end starter) and Tyson Bagent (undrafted rookie backup). If the defense isn't quite as good as we thought -- especially against the run -- maybe the Saints can crank up a passing game that should be better. I'd like to see more targets for Rashid Shaheed , and maybe the bye week gave Juwan Johnson more time to reacclimate after his midseason calf injury."
2023,12,16,Indianapolis Colts,5-5,"All of a sudden, if you look closely, the Colts making the playoffs isn't some pipe dream. At 5-5, they have work to do, but they're currently the second AFC team out of the playoffs, behind only Buffalo on the bubble. Indianapolis comes out of the bye fresh to host the Bucs , who have lost five of six, and then hits the road for two games that suddenly don't look so daunting: at Tennessee and Cincinnati . Will Levis has come back to earth after his strong debut , with the Titans losing three straight, and Joe Burrow's season-ending injury sure makes the trip to Cincy easier. I predict Jonathan Taylor takes this team and carries it on his back, with Zack Moss as his brilliant understudy. If those two backs dominate, minimizing the Gardner Minshew factor a bit, the Colts could ride right into the postseason."
2023,12,17,Denver Broncos,5-5,"In the past three games, Denver's defense has forced 12 turnovers -- that's more takeaways that six teams have produced all season . In related news, the Broncos are suddenly rolling, winning four straight after the 1-5 start. It should be noted the run defense has been a problem in the past couple games, but theyâre making it work. The offense moved the ball fairly well against the Vikings , and though settling for five field goals (four in the red zone) will sometimes come back to bite a team, Denver finished it off with the late TD drive. It was Russell Wilson to Courtland Sutton again, their fifth straight game connecting for a touchdown and the second straight that they did so in spectacular fashion . Four of the final seven games are on the road, but the Broncos have completely turned their season around."
2023,12,18,Cincinnati Bengals,5-5,"No matter how you spin it, the Joe Burrow injury is a near-fatal blow to the Bengals. Because even if Jake Browning is Kurt Warner 2.0, Cincinnati's still just 5-5 right now, in last place in a very competitive division with bad tiebreakers (0-3 vs. the AFC North, 1-5 vs. all AFC teams) and a very tough schedule with no gimme games left. On top of that, we don't know when WR Tee Higgins might be ready to go, and the banged-up defense has taken a step backward in the past two games, allowing 949 yards combined. A season that began with Super Bowl aspirations is suddenly on the brink. Browning handled himself OK in relief on Thursday , and it will be a great story if he shines, but Cincy has ample work ahead."
2023,12,19,Los Angeles Chargers,4-6,"It's time to wonder if this team will ever break through under Brandon Staley. The Chargers have a talented and fairly balanced roster, but they're 4-6 this season (despite outscoring opponents by 21) and 23-21 overall under Staley -- and his lackluster defense has been a big reason why the Bolts have struggled. Five of this season's six losses have come by three points or fewer, and Los Angeles has experienced a late-game breakdown -- usually on defense -- in each one. That said, poor red-zone execution by the offense was probably the biggest reason why the Chargers lost at Green Bay . That had been one of the few things they'd excelled at. Not on Sunday. L.A. went just 1-for-4 in the red area on Sunday, with two big drops by Keenan Allen and a fumble by Austin Ekeler . Rookie Quentin Johnston also dropped what could have been a 70-yard touchdown pass in the final 30 seconds, sealing the Bolts' fate. More pain and shame."
2023,12,20,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,4-6,"After a good showing against the Titans , Tampa Bay's defense had a humbling outing on Sunday . The unit was picked apart by Brock Purdy , spared a bit by the 49ers going 2-for-4 in the red zone and 4-for-10 on third downs. But the Buccaneers allowed 400-plus yards for the fourth time in five games and didnât force a turnover for only the second time all season. The secondary was roasted for seven completions of 15 or more yards, including a 76-yard TD and catches of 40 and 37 . Jamel Dean was injured on the long touchdown, one of three starting Bucs defenders to be hurt in the game, along with CB Carlton Davis III and LB Lavonte David . QB Baker Mayfield hung tough, but he turned the ball over twice deep in San Francisco territory. Tampa Bay is still in the NFC South race , but lost ground with the setback and two divisional foes on bye."
2023,12,21,Las Vegas Raiders,5-6,"Antonio Pierce suffered his first loss as interim coach, but the Raiders fought tooth and nail until the end and had plenty of shots to take the game in the second half. The Dolphins kept letting the Raiders hang around, but three Aidan OâConnell picks and a fourth-down stop after halftime did Las Vegas in. This is where the team is most vulnerable, when it needs the offense to take a big drive down the field and close it out. The defense, however, has kept up its end of the bargain for a few weeks now. The Raiders allowed 422 yards, with Tyreek Hill carving them up for a half, but Las Vegas matched Miamiâs three takeaways and kept the game close. At 5-6, the Raiders are running out of time, but give Pierce credit for keeping the team highly competitive."
2023,12,22,Green Bay Packers,4-6,"Here we go again? The 2022 Packers sat in the very same seat this yearâs team occupies now, at 4-6 with a possible path to the postseason. Does it feel likely after an emotional win over the Chargers ? Well, it does when you see that Green Bay is the first team out of the playoff field on the NFC side , and the Vikingsâ loss to the Broncos didnât hurt. Believe it not, the Packers might even be able to get in with losses in the next two games (which would put them at an unseemly 4-8), but likely only if they win their final five games in that scenario. Would that be probable? No. So a win on Thanksgiving Day over the Lions is really their best way to kick-start a run, which they couldnât finish last season with Aaron Rodgers . Is Jordan Love , who is playing his best ball of the season, capable? If he can somehow rally this team into the playoffs, the narrative on him will dramatically change."
2023,12,23,Atlanta Falcons,4-6,"Head coach Arthur Smithâs decision to turn back to Desmond Ridder seems like the right move, but that doesnât guarantee it will work out. Ridder led four game-winning drives and appeared to be making some real progress earlier this season. He was his own worst enemy at times, though, whether he was taking sacks, throwing interceptions or fumbling the ball away. It feels like Ridder is often too tightly wound, and that might be a coaching issue. Yes, heâs being asked at times to operate as a caretaker, but heâs been better in got-to-have-it situations. This is a ground-based team, but taking some early-game play-action shots to Drake London and Kyle Pitts could do an offense good. Might even build the quarterbackâs confidence a bit, too."
2023,12,24,Los Angeles Rams,4-6,"Down nine points in the fourth quarter at home, the Rams saved their scant playoff hopes with two scoring drives in the final eight minutes, a huge interception and some quality breath-holding on Jason Myersâ missed 55-yarder in the waning seconds. This game, like the OT winner in Indy earlier this season, was a reminder that the Rams have a pretty darned good coach. Sean McVay hasnât had anything close to a full deck to play with, and even this seasonâs sunniest projections always carried a measure of doubt with this team. A lot of that doubt surfaced during the three-game losing streak, along with Matthew Stafford âs injury. But Sunday, the Rams scrapped their way to a season-saving win over a division foe -- and, at 4-6, they arenât as far out of the playoff chase as you might assume."
2023,12,25,New York Jets,4-6,"Robert Saleh benched Zach Wilson in a blowout, inserted Tim Boyle (who was worse) and said on Monday that Boyle would start against Miami this week in the âBlack Fridayâ game . Whether Boyle ends up starting one game or for the rest of the season, heâs likely to struggle if the Jetsâ blocking continues to be horrific. And though Salehâs defense kept the Jets in Sundayâs game for a half, I thought Sauce Gardner hurt his team. His hold in the end zone helped set up a Bills TD, and what looked like a frustration penalty -- unnecessary roughness for suplexing Stefon Diggs after the whistle had blown -- didnât help. Neither did Gardnerâs decision to undercut Josh Allen âs pass to Khalil Shakir that ended up an 81-yard score . Basically, nothing is working well now, and the season is slipping away."
2023,12,26,Washington Commanders,4-7,"The Commanders have delivered one home victory, way back in Week 1 against the Cardinals . That canât be what new owner Josh Harris wants to see, and it had head coach Ron Rivera answering questions about his status after an embarrassing home loss to the Giants, who swept Washington this season. A 2-0 start has devolved into a 4-7 mess after Tommy DeVito lit up the Commandersâ secondary and Sam Howell threw three ghastly interceptions, the last of which was run back 56 yards for a soul-crushing touchdown . If Rivera is to stop the bleeding, itâs going to require some pretty big developments, and the Commanders visit the Cowboys on Thanksgiving , then host the Dolphins ."
2023,12,27,Tennessee Titans,3-7,"Mike Vrabelâs job security is being questioned after three straight losses. Vrabel is 51-41 as a head coach and has two postseason victories. I believe many teams would love to have him as head coach. But the Titans are now 3-14 over their past 17 games dating back to last season, when they were 7-3 entering Week 12 but dropped seven straight to hand the division to Jacksonville. It looks like Tennessee will miss the playoffs again following Sunday's loss , and the lack of talent on the roster appears to be a big reason why. If the Titans lose seven straight this year, will Vrabel be able to keep his job? This offseason, the Titans are projected to have more than $100 million in cap space and plenty of draft ammo, so Vrabel will have motivation to try to rally Will Levis and Tennessee's defense to stay competitive."
2023,12,28,Chicago Bears,3-8,"Sundayâs performance offered virtually everything a Bears fan could have wanted to see from Justin Fields in his first game back from a thumb injury, with the third-year QB leading six scoring drives and playing mostly terrific football. His TD pass to DJ Moore was an absolute beauty, and Fields was a monster on the ground (mostly on designed runs), rushing for 108 yards. When he converted that third-and-14 in the fourth quarter, I assumed the Bears would go on to win, but then they drained just 26 seconds of clock on a three-and-out as Fields just missed the knockout punch late. The strip-sack of Fields in the final seconds also marred what was a pretty good day for a scorned Chicago offensive line, too. The Bears have come a long way, but they still have to be better to finish off games."
2023,12,29,New York Giants,3-8,"Sundayâs victory had to feel pretty good to Brian Daboll. The season has been an utter disaster, befallen by a rash of injuries, with the prior two losses featuring some sideline incidents and bickering among the players. Thatâs never a good look, and it was nowhere to be found Sunday as the Giantsâ defense turned in arguably its best performance of the season, holding the Commanders to 19 points and forcing five turnovers, with a sixth one coming on special teams. Most importantly, the Giantsâ best defenders came to play after their unit had no answers the prior two games. Now Big Blue hosts the wayward Patriots in a winnable game and could enter the bye on a two-game win streak."
2023,12,30,Arizona Cardinals,2-9,"Itâs clear that while the Cardinals were a plucky team early in the season, theyâre suddenly pretty dangerous with Kyler Murray back, even if they couldnât finish off a fourth-quarter drive in Sunday's loss at Houston . They might even win two or three more games down the stretch, as Jonathan Gannon -- come hell or high water -- reminded us on Sunday that heâs going to absolutely go for it on fourth downs and play to win every game. The defense was mostly lost in the first half, but Gannonâs group was pretty terrific after that, shutting down C.J. Stroud and the Texans despite losing three key defenders during the game: Kyzir White (headed to injured reserve), Leki Fotu (who had a great game) and Antonio Hamilton (on his INT ). This is a fun team to keep an eye on now."
2023,12,31,New England Patriots,2-8,"Maybe Mac Jones keeps his job, maybe he doesnât . But it would be fascinating to consider the Patriotsâ three other options. Yes, three . Bailey Zappe is the obvious Plan B, but his August release always made me feel Bill OâBrien didnât see him as a great fit. The bizarre late-game pick against the Colts might not have helped his chances. But donât forget the Pats also have Will Grier (remember him?) as the third QB, plus Malik Cunningham , who took QB and WR snaps in the preseason. If itâs not Jones, Iâd be fascinated to see Grier get a look. He had two forgettable starts for Carolina in 2019 and hasnât played in the regular season since. But Grier has hung around and had some big preseason performances, even if heâs known for taking too many sacks. Thereâs no magic elixir on the bench, but a change could be healthy."
2023,12,32,Carolina Panthers,1-9,"If you want to win with Bryce Young right now, everything has to be pretty perfect. The offense must play turnover-free ball -- or have the defense extract more net takeaways. Carolina must play disciplined, ball-control football. You can see thatâs what the Panthers want to do, but some bad first-half penalties against Dallas threw a wrench into those plans. Young showed some nice things on the long, patient TD drive in the third quarter. But as soon as the Cowboys hit the gas pedal again, Young came unglued. He threw a pick-six and lost a fumble on a sack (one of seven he took), and that was the moment the pregame battle plans were immolated. Sunday's loss is yet another step backward after the win over the Texans and another painful reminder of how unlikely that lone W was for the Panthers."
2023,13,1,Philadelphia Eagles,10-1,"Once again, the Eagles were outplayed for long stretches by a talented foe, and once again, they came out with a victory. Last week delivered two of the more emotional and meaningful nonconference victories a team can nab, with Jalen Hurts leading just as many second-half TD drives as Philadelphia needed to win on Monday and then Sunday . The Eagles were down 10 points in the third quarter at Arrowhead in Week 11's Monday nighter. They were also down 10 points to the Bills on Sunday, but James Bradberry made a play , and that was enough to shift the game back in Philly's favor. Sure, the Eagles needed about 14 more things to go their way after that, and the defense had to get off the field a few times to secure the win. As it was, they gave up 505 yards and were on the field for 92 plays in the rain."
2023,13,2,Baltimore Ravens,9-3,"The Ravens have led at the start of every fourth quarter this season. Theyâve hit the bye in the No. 1 slot in the AFC and own a 1.5-game lead in a division where two other teams have lost their starting quarterbacks and the third isnât exactly blown away by its QB1. But for whatever reason, Baltimore has a nasty habit of leaving the door open late, sometimes against inferior teams. Sunday night ended with a win , but the Ravens gave the Chargers all kinds of chances to steal the game. This has happened in victories over the Bengals and Cardinals , and it certainly was a problem in losses to the Colts , Steelers and Browns . Yet the Ravens stomped the Lions and Seahawks . Perhaps this wonât be a problem, but itâs currently one of the few fissures in the fortress, as the Ravens are clearly in the hunt for their first Super Bowl in more than a decade."
2023,13,3,San Francisco 49ers,8-3,"The division crown isnât completely sewn up, but itâs getting there. The 49ers have dominated the NFC West lately, winning 10 straight games against their most familiar foes. The next mantle is the NFCâs No. 1 seed , with the Eagles on tap this week in Philadelphia . San Francisco has work to do to catch Philly, but winning Sunday would be a huge step in that direction. This team has completely realigned itself after the three-game losing streak, winning the past three comfortably by double digits. Nearly every hole we poked in the Niners during the skid has been answered since, headlined by Brock Purdy âs reemergence and the rediscovery of the pass rush. Now they catch Philadelphia at a fascinating juncture, with the Eagles coming off an emotional seven-day span that included comeback wins over the Chiefs and Bills . Will the 49ers be the next late-game victim, or are they due to end Phillyâs magic run?"
2023,13,4,Kansas City Chiefs,8-3,"The offense got back in rhythm after the early 14-0 deficit to the Raiders, scoring four touchdowns in a five-drive span to build a two-score lead, and using more than three minutes of clock on the late field-goal drive that helped ice a 31-17 win . The Chiefs got a big game Sunday from rookie receiver Rashee Rice and the most theyâve gotten from second-year wideout Skyy Moore since September. It was a start, and a mostly encouraging one, considering that the Chiefs committed zero turnovers, allowed just one sack and had only one clear dropped pass on Patrick Mahomes â 34 pass attempts. Defensively, Kansas City was bad for the first 20 minutes and great for the final 40. It wasnât a perfect effort, but it was a more-than-satisfactory bounceback after the emotional loss to the Eagles."
2023,13,5,Dallas Cowboys,8-3,"Dak Prescott is on a six-game heater, averaging 312.3 passing yards per game with an 18:2 TD-to-INT ratio. I am not sure heâs ever had a better six-pack of games at a more critical juncture for the team. A year ago at this time, Prescott was starting off an ignominious streak that would ultimately reach seven games with at least one pick. But ever since the humiliating loss at San Francisco back in Week 5, Dak's dialed in this season. Heâs at least an MVP dark horse at this point -- and could end up taking home the hardware if the Cowboys go nuclear down the stretch. Now is the time for folks who decried Mike McCarthy taking over play-calling duties to start the season to offer up their mea culpa , as you couldnât hope for much better results lately. Dallas hasnât been in a conference championship game in almost 30 years. Could this be the season?"
2023,13,6,Miami Dolphins,8-3,"Black Friday turned dark when Jaelan Phillips went down with a season-ending Achilles injury . That shouldnât negate the progress the Dolphinsâ defense has made since about Week 8, nor should it dismiss the seven sacks, two interceptions and momentum-changing, 99-yard touchdown Vic Fangioâs defense collected in thrashing the Jets . The run defense and pass rush have been unquestionable strengths, and Phillips was a big part of that. Heâs certainly not an easy player to replace, either. That said, it was encouraging that Emmanuel Ogbah , a disappointment since his massive extension in March of 2022 , had perhaps his best game of the season Sunday. Bradley Chubb has come on, too, as has Andrew Van Ginkel . The secondary is starting to play lights out. So, while the Phillips loss is big, Miamiâs ascending defense shouldnât just fall off a cliff without the stud edge rusher."
2023,13,7,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-3,"Trevor Lawrence 's production hasn't been mind-blowing, but his third NFL season is emerging as a very good one, following a bit of a slow start. In Sunday's win over the Texans, Lawrence nearly threw for a career high in yards. Even factoring in the humbling 49ers loss in Week 10 , Lawrence has been at his best in recent games, with his confidence clearly rising when it comes to taking deeper kill shots. His massive second half against Houston helped the Jaguars hold off the Texans and maintain a strong edge in the AFC South, with six games left and only one more true powerhouse ( Baltimore in Week 15 ) remaining on Jacksonville's schedule. There's bad news, too, with LT Cam Robinson out for at least the next four games . We know what happened when he missed the first four, as the offense never quite reached peak form. The Jags are almost certainly in the playoffs , but they can't afford to have the offense fall apart as we creep into December."
2023,13,8,Detroit Lions,8-3,"The lack of defensive plays hasnât been a season-long issue, but it has become a more chronic one of late. Seeing that unit struggle to stop the Packers on Thanksgiving wasnât a complete shock to anyone who has watched Lions football over the past two months or so. What was stunning was the lack of pass protection for Jared Goff . Sure, the veteran QB was his own worst enemy and suddenly has become devastatingly turnover-prone, but the offensive lineâs breakdown against Green Bay was a surprise if youâve been attuned to Detroit. Is that the way itâs going to be from here on out? The truth is that the Lions can still lose a few games and win the division. But if they want to win their first playoff game in over three decades, these issues need fixing by January."
2023,13,9,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-4,"The very first scrimmage play of Sunday's win over the Bengals sent us a clear message: Things will be different offensively. Kenny Pickett dropped back and fired a pass right down the middle of the Cincinnati defense to Pat Freiermuth . This was Freiermuth's second game back from a hamstring injury that had kept him out since Week 4 -- and in a pleasant development, he was actually used down the seam Sunday. That's an area of the field Pickett had roundly ignored most of the season. New play-caller Mike Sullivan led an attack that netted just 16 points, but the Steelers dialed up 424 yards of offense, the first time this season Pittsburgh has outgained an opponent -- and the Steelers nearly doubled the Bengals' output (222). We'll see if more points follow those yards next time out, but Sullivan had a good first outing in place of the fired Matt Canada ."
2023,13,10,Cleveland Browns,7-4,"With another week comes another QB situation for Cleveland. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was playing relatively well when he suffered a concussion and left Sunday's loss to Denver. In came PJ Walker , who connected on just 6 of his 13 pass attempts and was sacked for a safety late. Say what you will about Walker, but he did quarterback the important wins over the 49ers and Colts and would figure to be the first option this Sunday against the Rams if DTR can't go. But don't forget: Cleveland also signed Joe Flacco to the practice squad, and if things get dicey down the stretch, you can't rule out a fourth QB taking a start for the 7-4 Browns. They remain in a better spot to make the playoffs than to miss them, but QB uncertainty and a suddenly struggling run defense are cropping up at exactly the wrong time."
2023,13,11,Houston Texans,6-5,"Coming up short against the Jaguars means the Texans have their work cut out for them if they want to make the playoffs . This one stings because the Jags are more than a game up in the AFC South and currently hold the tiebreakers, with better division and conference marks. The Texans certainly had their chances to win, but some painful penalties on both sides of the ball really hurt. So did C.J. Stroud 's three second-half sacks, shaky coverage in the secondary ( Tavierre Thomas had a forgettable game) and the missed field-goal tries at the end of each half by Matt Ammendola . There's still a clear path to the postseason for Houston, but it starts with a win over 6-5 Denver in Week 13 and might stretch all the way to the Week 18 game at Indianapolis."
2023,13,12,Buffalo Bills,6-6,"Buffalo's playoff hopes are not dead, but theyâre fleeting after the Bills couldnât pull off what would have been an impressive road victory at Philadelphia in soggy conditions. Josh Allen put on his cape at times, and Joe Brady made some nice play calls, but it wasnât enough, thanks to: two missed kicks; Allenâs fourth-quarter pick ; a few defensive breakdowns; some bad luck on the fumble/non-fumble front; and the miscommunication with Gabe Davis on the throw in overtime. Yep, a handful of plays killed the Billsâ best offensive showing since the Miami game back in Week 4 and another step forward for Allen, who weaponized his legs far more than he has in recent games. Now, following this week's bye, Buffalo is tasked with a trip to Arrowhead , followed by a home game against the surging Cowboys . Each loss just feels existential now."
2023,13,13,Indianapolis Colts,6-5,"We gave you the premonitory playoff warning in last week's rankings , and that was when the Colts were in the AFC's No. 9 slot. Thanks to Sunday's solid victory over the Bucs and losses by Buffalo and Houston , the Colts have slid into the seventh and final playoff spot -- for now. Why hasn't there been more Shane Steichen Coach of the Year buzz? Perhaps it's because his offense has been tepid at times, even considering the QB situation , and the Colts lost three straight games not long ago. But now they've quietly won three straight, with the Jonathan Taylor - Zack Moss duo punishing Tampa Bay for four quarters Sunday. Michael Pittman Jr. has been on a great clip since mid-October, too, and his free-agent price tag keeps going up with every big game he stacks ... But that's a conversation for another day. Right now, there's a playoff murmur in Indy. EDITOR'S UPDATE: After publishing on Tuesday, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Jonathan Taylor suffered a thumb injury that will require surgery force him to miss a couple of weeks."
2023,13,14,Seattle Seahawks,6-5,"At 6-5, theyâre by no means in great shape, considering they now must face the 8-3 Cowboys , 8-3 49ers (who stomped them on Thanksgiving in Seattle) and 10-1 Eagles , with the first two on the road. Lose all three, and the playoffs might be toast. Win one, and thereâs still a lot of work to do. So thatâs whatâs facing a Seahawks team that hasnât looked quite right since October. Looking back, getting swept by the Rams will sting (especially that Week 11 clunker). The red zone collapse against the Bengals also will linger if the 'Hawks miss out on the postseason. The blowout losses to the 49ers and Ravens suggest this team will have a tough time rising up against a fierce array of opponents down the stretch, especially if Geno Smith and the offense canât right their wrongs quickly."
2023,13,15,Denver Broncos,6-5,"The Broncos forced only one turnover in their first three outings -- and now, incredibly, they lead the NFL in takeaways with 22. Twenty-one of them have come in their past eight games, and a stunning 15 have been in the past four. Not shockingly, Denver's 0-3 start coincided with a turnover differential of minus-4 -- since then, the Broncos have gone 6-2, with five straight wins, while logging a turnover differential of plus-12. The defense has allowed nine scores in the past six games combined , looking unrecognizable next to the unit that gave up 10 TDs to Miami in Week 3 . Pair that with Russell Wilson 's excellent ball security (he's recorded zero picks in five straight games, with just eight turnovers on the season), and we can reasonably talk playoffs now. Four of Denver's final six games are on the road, including the next three, so this is no time for parades. But Sean Payton's first season already has been a success, thanks to the massive turnaround."
2023,13,16,Minnesota Vikings,6-6,"For three and a half quarters on Monday night, Josh Dobbs almost undid all the goodwill he'd earned since arriving in Minnesota. It wasn't all his fault, but Dobbs made some horrendous decisions in key moments. The first pick never had a chance. The second went off Jordan Addison 's hands but could have been thrown better. The third hit K.J. Osborn 's hands -- and it came on fourth down, so no harm, no foul. The fourth one , Dobbs needed to eat it. It was a screen, and the Bears had it read. These were the kinds of plays Dobbs started making more often in his more recent starts in Arizona. There was some magic early in the desert, but it petered out. Is that playing out all over again in Minneapolis? Despite Minnesota finally putting together a touchdown drive to take the lead in the fourth quarter, Chicago ultimately marched back down the field for the game-winning field goal . Now the Vikings' strange season has careened into the bye, with the five-game win streak feeling strangely distant now."
2023,13,17,New Orleans Saints,5-6,"After a midseason flurry of productivity, the offense is back in slump mode. Derek Carr racked up 305 passing yards against the Falcons , but he can't seem to get this team into the end zone. His pick and Taysom Hill's fumble in the red zone basically decided the game. New Orleans lost by two scores, but just as easily could have won by two. That speaks to the mediocrity of this team and the NFC South, which keeps things open for now. Carr just hasn't brought this offense together the way I imagined. The early-season OL issues can't be ignored, and it's hard to know who is to blame when Carr and his receivers aren't on the same page. The Saints need to fix the communication errors and red-zone woes fast, because this defense can't stop a good run game."
2023,13,18,Green Bay Packers,5-6,"The Packers are suddenly 5-6, and making the playoffs is not an unrealistic possibility at this point. In fact, Green Bay is one win ahead of its pace in 2022, when the Packers stayed in the playoff race until a Week 18 loss . Rashan Gary and Jordan Love helped fuel the rousing Thanksgiving victory over the Lions, which is exactly how you want it as a Packers fan. Gary, who recovered from a torn ACL suffered last season, fell into a four-game sackless streak around the time that he signed a $96 million contract extension, while Love threw 10 picks between Weeks 3 and 10. But both were humming in a big game, despite the team missing several key contributors on each side of the ball. You love to see that at this time of year."
2023,13,19,Atlanta Falcons,5-6,"The Falcons have yo-yoed from the teens to the mid-20s in the Power Rankings all season -- win or loss, back and forth -- and there's a reason for that. Sunday's victory marked a tick up in the right direction, as the team took an important step toward winning the NFC South. But two red-zone turnovers by the Saints -- both tremendous plays by Jessie Bates III -- were required for Atlanta to survive the game, even though the Falcons won by two scores. The run game has been the backbone of Atlanta's offense all season, as it was Sunday, with even Cordarrelle Patterson getting in on the action. Desmond Ridder had two rough interceptions, but rallied for two late scoring drives. It's the same formula we've seen time and time again. Will it be enough for the Falcons to take the division?"
2023,13,20,Cincinnati Bengals,5-6,"Losing Joe Burrow , it turns out, was a big deal. Jake Browning wasn't the sole reason the Bengals lost to Pittsburgh on Sunday, but he also didn't win it for them. Whoever came up with the game plan might want to reconsider the run-pass ratio. Counting his two scrambles, Browning dropped back to throw 32 times, and the Bengals handed to Joe Mixon eight times. That's a 4:1 pass-to-run ratio, with Burrow and Tee Higgins injured. The Bengals crossed midfield five times, but scored just 10 points. Their longest, most promising drive came at the start of the second half, moving 57 yards and draining nearly six minutes of clock, but it ended with a bad Browning pick in the red zone. The Bengals led 7-3 at that point, but would go on to lose their third straight."
2023,13,21,Los Angeles Chargers,4-7,"With WRs Mike Williams and Josh Palmer out, the opportunity has been there for first-round pick Quentin Johnston to grab a share of the offense. But outside of some brief flashes, Johnston has been a disappointment. After a drop and a visit to the medical tent against the Ravens on Sunday night , Johnston never reentered a close, winnable game. Likewise, Michael Davis has had a clear chance to show he was worth the $25 million extension the team signed him to a few years ago, with the J.C. Jackson disaster ending via Jackson's trade to the Patriots . But on Sunday, Davis sat in favor of Deane Leonard . We can talk about coaching until we're (Chargers) blue in the face, but we'd need to have an earnest conversation about personnel, too. The 4-7 record can't all be blamed on Brandon Staley."
2023,13,22,Los Angeles Rams,5-6,"There's a glut of five- and six-win teams in the NFC right now, all jockeying for what will probably be two available wild-card spots (presuming the 10-1 Eagles or 8-3 Cowboys will take one), and the Rams are right back in the thick of it. It has been a strange season for sure, but the return of Kyren Williams and the unexpected breakout game from Tyler Higbee (after it was thought he might not play) on Sunday gave the offense the boost it needed. The Rams' defense had one of its finest efforts, and even against the Cardinals, that had to be a confidence-boosting performance for a group that's been put through the ringer a few times. There are two whopper road games left -- at Baltimore and San Francisco -- but the other four are winnable, beginning with Sunday's game against a Browns team that could be starting Joe Flacco ."
2023,13,23,Las Vegas Raiders,5-7,"Though he was listed on the Raiders' injury report as doubtful with a knee injury, Maxx Crosby played 49 of a possible 60 defensive snaps, helping Las Vegas get out to a strong start against the Chiefs and sacking Patrick Mahomes on a big third down early in the second half . The Raiders also received a huge game from Josh Jacobs , who had the second-longest run of his career and topped 100 rushing yards for the second time in his past three outings. Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers both chipped in readily. But it still wasn't enough to hang on against Kansas City, which outscored Las Vegas 31-3 over the final 40 minutes of the game. The Raiders' effort under interim head coach Antonio Pierce has been commendable. But the offense has been far too inconsistent to finish drives -- and that can't all be put on Aidan O'Connell 's head. Pierce needs to score more points if he is to secure the full-time job."
2023,13,24,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,4-7,"The Bucs aren't out of it, with their record at 4-7 and the Saints and Falcons both at 5-6. It's nice that Tampa has been in every game since the Week 5 bye, but the 1-6 streak has revealed some ugly trends. The defense has stopped taking the ball away and has experienced major tackling issues. Red-zone performance has been a problem on offense. Injuries haven't helped, either. Baker Mayfield made some gutsy throws on Sunday , playing through an ankle injury that forced him to leave briefly, but he also had two costly turnovers that hurt his team on the road against a hungry Colts squad. The Bucs just seem to be four or five plays short of victory every week. Even with the obvious bright spots on offense, it's hard to get too excited about their chances of getting in the Big Dance ."
2023,13,25,Chicago Bears,4-8,"It was by no means an ""I'm the guy"" performance from Justin Fields , but give him a smidge of credit for coming back from the two fourth-quarter fumbles to lead the game-winning field goal drive on the road against a team in the playoff hunt . The 36-yard shot to DJ Moore was a well-schemed play and good throw on a night when Fields left a lot of meat on the bone. There were plays to be made, and he missed some big ones. Fields started the game 13-of-13 for 122 yards, making a few plays with his legs, but the Bears just couldn't find the end zone -- all night long . That said, a win is a win. Credit the defense for the four interceptions and the massive three-and-out after Fields' second fumble. Matt Eberflus has his team playing very hard and pretty well late in the season."
2023,13,26,Tennessee Titans,4-7,"The Titans just know how to win games in Nashville, improving to 4-0 in non-London home contests on Sunday -- and they still have four more dates at Nissan Stadium. The playoffs almost certainly aren't within reach , but Tennessee can finish strong and decide whether Will Levis is the guy to build around. I remain fairly bullish. Levis had a very nice first half against Carolina, leading two TD marches and a pretty field-goal drive in the final 30 seconds. He cooled off after that and almost got in some trouble trying to force the ball to DeAndre Hopkins , but overall, Levis showed more positives than negatives, which is consistent with my season-long takeaway. He's arguably displayed more upside with the Titans than Bryce Young has with the Panthers, even if comparing the two situations is like comparing apples to kumquats."
2023,13,27,New York Jets,4-7,"The last time the Jets traded for a quarterback from the Packers only for their season to crater, it cost people jobs. Head coach Eric Mangini was fired following his third season in 2008, and Brett Favre eventually was released after one hopeful but fruitless year in New York. The situation in present-day Jetsdom feels strangely similar. Aaron Rodgers still remains on track to return in record time from his Achilles injury, but to what end? Could he throw Robert Saleh -- in danger of logging a third straight losing season -- a lifeline? Could Rodgers somehow light a fire under this torched group? That might feel like a far-fetched proposition, with the Jets at 4-7 and almost certainly out of the playoffs . Perhaps Rodgers sees a long-game purpose, rolling the momentum of a strong return into 2024, or maybe he wants to get something out of this campaign after the Jets sold out to cater to Rodgers' needs this past offseason. Either way, the hope of a potential Rodgers comeback is about the one big drama remaining for the Jets."
2023,13,28,New York Giants,4-8,"The Giants finally had a player top 100 receiving yards in a game this season! All it took was 12 weeks and three different quarterbacks. On Sunday , Jalin Hyatt crossed the century mark while catching passes from Tommy DeVito against the Patriots -- scenes from August reprised in late November. The two rookies stood tall, helping deliver a second straight victory amid a season of disappointment. Even taking into account the fluctuatons at QB this year, Hyatt's production has been a bit scattershot, but he can change a game with just a few grabs. Now, the question is whether Brian Daboll sticks with the improving DeVito or goes back to Tyrod Taylor , who can come off injured reserve in Week 14. That likely will be the talk of the Week 13 bye, which is a far better scenario than most 4-8 teams face."
2023,13,29,Washington Commanders,4-8,"The remaining five games of the 2023 season will be interesting, with the fates of virtually every important figure in the franchise (save the owner) potentially at stake. Is Sam Howell the QB of the future? The team could end up in a draft position where selecting a quarterback in 2024 is possible, so even an encouraging season from Howell won't necessarily assure his place in the team's plans. Will Eric Bieniemy be part of the franchise going forward? Until we know Josh Harris' plans for head coach Ron Rivera and the front office, it's nearly impossible to say, but it wouldn't be unprecedented for a holdover coordinator to remain even if (many) others do not. There are some promising elements for a rebuild here, including Howell's presence on a rookie salary, but there is a lot to figure out in the next six months or so."
2023,13,30,Arizona Cardinals,2-10,"This was a setback in the Kyler Murray Refurbishment Project, as nothing seemed to go right for the offense Sunday against the Rams after the opening-drive touchdown. Costly penalties, constant pressure and missed (easy) connections were a problem all day. These are the types of plays that will hinder Murray's development and the Cardinals' evaluation of him in these semi-important games down the stretch. Murray threw for almost half his yards in the fourth quarter with the Rams up big, didn't really scramble and was sacked four times, twice on third down. The run game in general wasn't working, and the Cardinals' defense had no answers for Kyren Williams and the Rams' offense. This was one of Arizona's worst efforts after a fair number of competitive outings."
2023,13,31,New England Patriots,2-9,"Whether Bill Belichick continues to coach in New England or not, the Patriots might end up with a 2024 draft selection high enough to consider quarterback options other than Mac Jones and Bailey Zappe next season. The current QB well has been spoiled, it appears, as the Pats sputtered away another game where the defense held its opponent to 10 points. Jones was benched (for the fourth time this season) in the second half, and after Zappe offered a ray of sunshine with a TD drive, he turned heel, throwing a bad pick into thick coverage. Maybe New England will go with Zappe down the stretch. Maybe it won't make a difference. These are Sisyphean matters at this point. A shockingly bad season has sunk further into the abyss. The Patriots are now 0-7 vs. teams outside the AFC East."
2023,13,32,Carolina Panthers,1-10,"No one should have expected these Panthers to light up scoreboards week in and week out, but they haven't passed the 15-point mark since mid-October. Frank Reich -- whose expertise is in offense -- and Bryce Young clearly weren't making the kinds of strides one would hope for before the head coach was dismissed on Monday . We're not sidestepping the talent problem; there are major limitations at receiver and on the offensive line. But even so, it's been frustrating to see the same station-to-station offense crawl up the field for one or two scoring drives and often squander a respectable defensive effort. Now Young is on to his second head coach, with yet another shift at offensive coordinator (Jim Caldwell will advise Thomas Brown, who regains the play-calling duties he had earlier this season ). And Young very well could have a new combination to work with in a few months."
2023,14,1,San Francisco 49ers,9-3,"They're back. For the first time since Week 7 , the 49ers are in the pole position. At least as far as these rankings go. As for the NFC's top seed , that remains a quest in progress, even after Sunday's monstrous, resounding victory in Philly . Did the Niners catch an Eagles team that had been put through the grinder lately? Sure. But that's what the playoffs are about, right? It's a weekly deathmatch, and second place is an extra week's vacation. Who wants to see these two teams meet again in the postseason? Yeah, just about all of us -- and it feels borderline inevitable at this point. If the 49ers carry a healthy offense into a rematch, it might be too much for the Eagles -- or any other foe, for that matter -- to handle. Brock Purdy has answered any question you could have conjured up during the three-game losing streak. He was the maestro before that -- and has been since."
2023,14,2,Baltimore Ravens,9-3,"After 12 straight weeks of games -- including a trek across the pond to London, two separate West Coast trips and consecutive prime-time games -- the Ravens more than earned their rest during the Week 13 bye. Even with a few slip-ups to their name, they've put themselves in a great spot to win the division and make a run at the AFC's top playoff seed -- and others have helped. The Steelers and Browns both lost Sunday, greasing the division skids a bit, and the Chiefs lost , making the path to a first-round bye smoother. The good news: Baltimore controls its fate. The bad: The schedule is a bear, with games remaining against Jacksonville and Miami , two teams also gunning for the top spot. There's also a possible Super Bowl preview on Dec. 25: Ravens at 49ers . Merry Christmas, everyone."
2023,14,3,Philadelphia Eagles,10-2,"The secret is out. The Eagles' short-handed linebacker group was exposed in Sunday's blowout loss to San Francisco , both in coverage and via the 49ers' run game. The tackling was bad; 115 of Deebo Samuel 's 116 receiving yards came after the catch. Truthfully, this has been an issue for a few weeks, but Philadelphia made critical stops against Dallas , Kansas City and Buffalo . That just did not happen against San Francisco. The Niners punted twice in their first two possessions ... then scored six straight touchdowns. It was a stunning sight in such a big game at the Linc, even if the Eagles are allowed to lose one every now and then. But it's the first time in a few years where they've really been outclassed . You can't blame Jalen Hurts missing time because it was a 28-13 game when he left and 35-13 when he returned -- likely the same score it would have been had he not missed a play. Monday's addition of veteran LB Shaq Leonard is intriguing, especially considering Philly beat out Dallas to sign him, but did the playoff-hungry Colts cut a player who can truly reverse the Eagles' recent defensive swoon?"
2023,14,4,Dallas Cowboys,9-3,"Since the loss to the Eagles , the Cowboys have gone 4-0, winning the first three of those games by an average of 30 points. This past Thursday's triumph was notable for the fact that Dallas never panicked despite Seattle leading for much of the second half. It's a testament to how dangerous the Cowboys' offense has become, even if the defense struggled to get off the field against the Seahawks. But the 'Boys now have extra rest coming into the big rematch against the Eagles in Dallas this Sunday night. The Eagles' Week 13 loss really invigorated the races for the NFC East crown and the conference's top seed . Dallas has won 14 straight at AT&T Stadium, but the defense will have some work to do after the Seahawks diced it up."
2023,14,5,Miami Dolphins,9-3,"I wrote last week that the Dolphins could survive the Jaelan Phillips injury, and through one game against the Commanders, they're 1-for-1 in that department, with a mostly dominant defensive showing on the road. But the 45-15 win over Washington also came with a cost: the knee injury to LB Jerome Baker , who has played a sneaky-big role on this Miami D. And the injuries weren't restricted to the defensive side of the ball, with OT Terron Armstead and OG Robert Hunt both leaving the game and exposing the offensive line. The Dolphins have proven themselves this season against the lower-rung teams in the NFL, but in Weeks 16 though 18, they must show it vs. the three-game gauntlet of Dallas , Baltimore and Buffalo . There are two home games against also-rans before that, and Miami's sitting pretty now at 9-3, but this less-than-healthy team can't afford too many more significant injuries."
2023,14,6,Kansas City Chiefs,8-4,"You can gripe about officiating -- it's your afforded right! -- but for uncomfortably long stretches Sunday night, Patrick Mahomes was throwing some funny-looking passes, and the defense was getting worked over. That's a few games now where Steve Spagnuolo's unit has put Kansas City in a two-score hole early and asked a struggling offense to bail the team out. It worked against the Raiders , but not against the Packers . In the past, this wasn't such a big worry, but now it is. I was surprised the Chiefs didn't run the ball more Sunday night. They averaged 6.3 yards per carry in the first half and 5.7 in the second. Isiah Pacheco was the best K.C. performer on a night when Mahomes was off and Travis Kelce (four receptions) was the only Chief able to catch a pass longer than 16 yards. Does Mahomes need to be nearly flawless for Kansas City to have a shot in the playoffs? It sort of feels that way."
2023,14,7,Detroit Lions,9-3,"The Lions have their best record through a dozen games since 1962, and they'd have to trip over about 14 rakes between now and Week 18 to miss the playoffs. There's an excellent chance they'll be hosting a postseason game, and they're not out of the race for the No. 1 seed. So why does it feel like there's a slight panic in Detroit ? Well, because the Lions have insisted on making the journey more stressful than it needs to be, nearly coughing up multiple-score leads against the Chargers and Saints , barely coming back to beat the Bears and opening the door for the Packers to come steal the NFC North. The offense turned in a cleaner game at New Orleans, with no turnovers after committing a combined seven over the previous two games. But the defense remains a concern, falling apart in the second half on Sunday despite knocking Derek Carr out of the game. There's just a general uneasiness around the Lions right now, especially with some tricky games down the stretch."
2023,14,8,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-4,"The Jaguars entered Monday night's game with a chance to move into the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed. They left it with a shocking loss to Jake Browning and the Bengals, and their season suddenly in serious question following the injuries to QB Trevor Lawrence (ankle) and WR Christian Kirk (groin) . Several other Jaguars were banged up in an ugly night at EverBank Stadium, where the home team dropped to 2-4 on the season. All hope isn't suddenly lost, but the Jaguars have to sweat out another short week with Lawrence an injury worry. The offense was hot and cold before Lawrence went down in the fourth quarter, and a missed 48-yard field goal didn't help, but Jacksonville's defense can take the blame for this one. Allowing Browning to complete 86 percent of his passes and the Bengals to rack up nearly 500 yards of offense just can't happen. Not for a team that was harboring Super Bowl dreams coming in. I almost moved the Texans ahead of the Jags, but I wanted to hear more about the Lawrence and Kirk injuries. EDITOR'S UPDATE: On Tuesday, Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said Trevor Lawrence suffered a high ankle sprain , while Christian Kirk has a core muscle injury and ""will miss some time."""
2023,14,9,Houston Texans,7-5,"They were bracing for the worst, having suffered their past three losses in heartbreaking fashion, and the Texansâ luck already felt gone after losing Tank Dell to what would be a season-ending injury . But Jimmie Ward âs game-clinching, final-minute, end-zone interception -- one of Houston's three critical picks Sunday -- clinched yet another dramatic victory , which is also something the Texans have come to know. The past five wins all came down to the wire in one-score games, so theyâve pulled out more close ones than theyâve not. Weâve touted other possibilities in this space, but DeMeco Ryans has to be among the favorites for Coach of the Year, right ? We know heâd love to do better offensively than 4-for-16 on third down and settling for three short field goals with a backup kicker. But the young Texans moved another step closer to the postseason, which seemed unimaginable even two months ago."
2023,14,10,Cleveland Browns,7-5,"We donât yet know Kevin Stefanskiâs plans at quarterback , but Joe Flacco played pretty well for a guy coming off his couch a few weeks ago. Flaccoâs bad pick started the avalanche that led to the Rams winning 36-19 , but it was a one-point Rams lead with less than seven minutes to go and the Browns potentially driving to take the lead. Dorian Thompson-Robinson is expected to be available for the Week 14 game against the Jaguars , but Flacco had the look (for most of the game) of a player equipped to handle a playoff-like atmosphere. The Browns are hanging on for their postseason lives right now, currently in the seventh slot ,. Clevelandâs defense, which has been mostly very good, arguably had its worst outing of the season Sunday. The Browns had better hope it was a one-game aberration, because they canât win without that part of the equation."
2023,14,11,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-5,"There have been numerous stretches where we've questioned whether the Steelers are truly a playoff team -- not whether they will get in, but whether they even deserve to. Following Sunday's shocking home loss to Arizona, the Steelers will be without starting QB Kenny Pickett for this Thursday's game against New England . He was knocked out in the second quarter Sunday with an ankle injury, but even prior to getting hurt, Pickett wasn't able to build on new play-caller Mike Sullivan's strong first outing the week before . Pittsburgh was also guilty of self-inflicted errors galore, including basic stuff like getting lined up correctly, before backup QB Mitch Trubisky's crippling fumble . Mike Tomlin has somehow led this team to 7-5, but it's hard not to get the smoke-and-mirrors vibe, especially with Pickett possibly set to miss multiple games . Heck, the Steelers have looked quite beatable with him."
2023,14,12,Buffalo Bills,6-6,"The Bills emerge from the bye still in the race but facing what could be two existential battles against playoff-caliber teams. First, they have to go to Kansas City and face the Chiefs , followed by a home game against the Cowboys . Two losses probably would sink Buffalo in a tight AFC field . Two wins would be a season-changer. A split likely extends the drama, but it doesnât change the heavy lifting still required to get in. Itâs too bad weâre at this point, because Josh Allen was the kind of player against the Eagles that weâve been waiting for him to be. Thatâs the Allen the Bills need down the stretch. The Billsâ injury-riddled defense doesn't appear to be the lockdown group it had been recently, and thatâs another reason to wonder if this miracle playoff run can even happen in the first place."
2023,14,13,Indianapolis Colts,7-5,"With Jonathan Taylor potentially set to miss multiple games , Indianapolis has to figure out its run game quickly. Zack Moss has done a pretty remarkable job replacing Taylor this season, but Sunday was a step back for the Coltsâ ground attack. They had a long run of 5 yards and averaged 2.4 yards per carry against the Titans . As a result, the Colts were 1-for-5 in the red zone, converting their first TD in that part of the field on the final play of the game . Gardner Minshew had a strong outing rallying Indianapolis, and Michael Pittman Jr. and Alec Pierce came up with some huge grabs in crunch time . The Colts deserve some credit for beating a division foe that was previously undefeated at Nissan Stadium, with the special teams as a huge catalyst , to extend their win streak to four games. But this was a little too close for comfort for an Indy team that lacks some tiebreakers and still needs to stack more wins to be safely in the playoffs."
2023,14,14,Green Bay Packers,6-6,"The season has been turned on its ear with Green Bay's statement victory over Kansas City , making it appear more likely right now that the Packers are in the playoffs than out, especially with a very favorable schedule down the stretch. Currently, theyâre slotted in the final NFC wild-card spot , with a tiebreaker over the Rams. Just think, the 2-5 Packers beating the 3-5 Rams in Week 9 is dictating the shape of the playoffs. Anyway, Green Bay is engineering a run (without David Bakhtiari or Aaron Jones ) behind Jordan Love âs emergence and a defense thatâs making timely stops. Turnovers tell a big part of the story. In the first nine games, Green Bay was minus-4 in turnover ratio. In the past three games? Plus-5. And to think, some Packers fans were warming to the idea of a Round 1 quarterback. Forget that for now. Love is here to stay."
2023,14,15,Seattle Seahawks,6-6,"The Seahawks' best offensive effort since arguably September was wasted when the defense essentially made one true stop during the game -- a third-quarter turnover on downs at the Seattle 30-yard line. Itâs hard to know where this team sits now, either offensively or defensively, because of the wild swings week to week and some lingering injuries. But the reality is this: After losing to the Cowboys , the Seahawks are 6-6, two spots out of the playoffs currently, with the 49ers (who dismantled the Seahawks on Thanksgiving) on tap in Santa Clara. After that, they host the Eagles , so this is going to be a mad dash for the playoffs, but one thatâs going uphill. Perhaps the return of Kenneth Walker III will help, and Geno Smith was clearly hurt last time against the 49ers (he looked far healthier against Dallas). So while thereâs playoff hope, Seattle might have to steal one against an NFC heavyweight to have a shot to get in."
2023,14,16,Denver Broncos,6-6,"Winning Sunday could have done such good for the Broncosâ playoff hopes, as they would have held tiebreakers over three of the teams theyâre jockeying with for wild-card spots. But Houston pulled it out late, dealing a blow to Denverâs chances. Late in the third quarter, it looked like the Broncos could eke out a victory after they had trailed 13-0 early. Russell Wilson suddenly was cooking, and the defense was lights out after a rough start, forcing four punts in five possessions. But Wilson threw the first of three picks in the final 16 minutes of play, with the last one coming in the end zone with a chance to win in the last minute. The defense put Denver in a hole early, and the offense couldnât quite pull it out late. The Broncos might need to go 4-1 down the stretch and get a little help to make the postseason now."
2023,14,17,Minnesota Vikings,6-6,"This week's post-bye game against the Raiders figures to have some real drama beyond whether Justin Jefferson plays or not. Thereâs a chance that head coach Kevin OâConnell could make a change at quarterback -- either before Sundayâs contest or during it -- given Joshua Dobbs â colossal struggles against the Bears in Week 12. At the very least, you can expect understudy Nick Mullens to be on ready-alert going into this game. Rookie Jaren Hall is back in the mix, too. This game -- and the stretch that follows -- not only will dictate whether the Vikings make the playoffs, but it likely will help determine the teamâs offseason plan at QB. Another concern: Can the offensive line, which has been a team strength, hold up down the stretch? It did not against Chicago."
2023,14,18,Cincinnati Bengals,6-6,"Maybe this is what happens when you hang out around Joe Burrow , but when did Jake Browning become a stone-cold killer? Time and time again Monday night, while Browning was dicing up the Jaguars , I kept thinking how relaxed the guy looked. I was ready to rip Zac Taylor for the disastrous Tyler Boyd trick-play turnover , which was a bad idea from the start. But it was about the one time in the second half Taylor didn't put the ball in Browning's hands and ask Burrow's replacement to win the game for him. Browning delivered in big way, completing a stunning 32 of 37 passes (with at least one clear drop) for 354 yards, notching a TD running and passing in the overtime win . The Bengals' playoff chances went from miniscule to merely remote, thanks to an incredible performance from Browning in his second NFL start. Wow."
2023,14,19,Atlanta Falcons,6-6,"The Falcons left Gotham as the sole first-place team in the NFC South, which is the obvious good news. The bad is that the offense took a step backward, gaining just 194 total yards against the Jets , with 11 of their 14 possessions failing to travel more than 14 yards. They endured five three-and-outs, and two possessions lost yardage -- including the first-quarter safety that put Atlanta in an early 2-0 hole. The fact that the Jets lost the turnover battle 3-0 but had the ball at gameâs end with a chance to win tells you everything you need to know about the Falconsâ scoring issues. And itâs not just about yards. They have as many 400-yard performances as the Eagles do this season ... but have yet to top 28 points. Even the Patriots have scored more in a game. Can Atlanta survive winning games this way? Its recent losses to teams such as Washington , Tennessee and Arizona suggest itâs not likely."
2023,14,20,Los Angeles Rams,6-6,"The topsy-turvy season took a turn for the positive with Sundayâs victory over the Browns . Thatâs now three straight wins (after three straight losses), and the Rams are all squared at 6-6. Nothing has been easy for this team this season, except for perhaps the adjustment of Puka Nacua to the NFL. After a few quieter outings in recent games, the rookie receiver fought through cramps and a rib injury Sunday to cross the 1,000-yard mark for the season, with four catches for 105 yards and a 70-yard TD , plus a 31-yard run that led to the go-ahead score. So here the Rams are with Nacua, Kyren Williams and Demarcus Robinson playing key offensive roles late in the season, and the playoffs still look well within reach, even with tough road games at Baltimore and San Francisco remaining."
2023,14,21,Los Angeles Chargers,5-7,"In the most Chargerian development imaginable, just as the defense has made admirable strides in recent games, the once-prolific offense has hit the skids. The formula worked, producing a surprising road shutout (the franchiseâs first since 2017), but the teamâs identity shift is pretty on brand. In Week 10, the Chargers and Lions combined for 954 yards in L.A.âs 41-38 loss . Since then, the Chargers have scored 20, 10 and six points ... while allowing 23, 20 and zero. The Patriots are a bad offensive team, but letâs not forget the Chargers held down the Ravens and Packers pretty well prior to that. What this means for the Bolts long-term is hard to say, but itâs pretty fitting that even in victories, this team has a hard time playing complete games where all three units acquit themselves well."
2023,14,22,New Orleans Saints,5-7,"It seems clear Saints fans havenât quite warmed up to QB Derek Carr yet, and Sunday was a fascinating case study of that relationship. Carr started slowly, and though his interception went off the hands of Juwan Johnson , Saints fans booed Carr anyway. Then he got hot, hitting 15 straight passes beginning in the second quarter, helping cut a 24-7 deficit to 24-21 during a third-quarter flurry. But when Carr lost a fumble on a poor center exchange, the fans booed more. He left the game a few minutes later with injuries, and Jameis Winston gave the Saints a chance to win it late, but quarterbacking wasnât the only factor here. The Saintsâ defense, once the teamâs unquestioned strength, now is a question mark, as the Lions flexed their muscles often against that group."
2023,14,23,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,5-7,"Do we appreciate Mike Evans enough? I mean, do we seriously grasp what kind of career heâs had? At some point Sunday , I saw a highlight of Evansâ 75-yard catch , with the announcer noting: âAnd heâs only 30 years old!â Look, I am pretty good with NFL playersâ ages, but how is a man with a decadeâs worth of consecutive 1,000-yard seasons only 30?! It defies logic. Randy Moss is second, with six straight such seasons to start a career. Up next for Evans is Jerry Rice, who holds the all-time mark with 14 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Come rain or shine, whether his team is in the postseason or not, the man always delivers. Heâll have a chance to keep Tampa Bay in the playoff race this Sunday in Atlanta . With the Bucs' defense thinned by injury and looking vulnerable at times, it might be up to Evans and the offense to shoulder the load."
2023,14,24,Las Vegas Raiders,5-7,"Aidan OâConnell still has the chance down the stretch to audition for the starting job next season, but through five starts, the fourth-round pick hasnât exceeded the level of play that Jimmy Garoppolo displayed this season, and Garoppolo was benched. Granted, thereâs a sliding scale for rookies, I assume, but you really canât rule out the idea of Antonio Pierce going back to Garoppolo if OâConnell doesnât improve. Pierce is trying to become the rare interim who keeps the job going forward. That means he needs to win games. The Raiders' last interim coach, Rich Bisaccia, went 7-5 two years ago after Jon Gruden was fired and led the Raiders to the playoffs, nearly stunning the Bengals on Super Wild Card Weekend -- but Bisaccia didnât earn the full-time gig. Right now, Pierce is 2-2 with a fairly challenging final five games remaining."
2023,14,25,Chicago Bears,4-8,"The Week 12 effort against Minnesota was commendable for a team that looked completely adrift in September. The franchiseâs three big pillars -- Justin Fields , Matt Eberflus and Ryan Poles -- have been putting in work. Fieldsâ return from injury was delayed, but it bore fruit with the win over the Vikings , even if his two fourth-quarter fumbles made it harder. Eberflus has led the Bears to a 4-4 record and a positive point differential over the past two months, following an 0-4 start. Poles acquired and wisely extended DE Montez Sweat , who is now second on the team in sacks in only four games. Will the final five games dictate the future path of the franchise? It feels that way."
2023,14,26,Tennessee Titans,4-8,"Though the Titans are 4-8, Sunday's loss was pretty momentous, given that it was their first true home L of the season, several Tennessee players were hurt during the game and the special teams coordinator lost his job the following day. Injuries to three relatively irreplaceable standouts (DT Jeffery Simmons , RB Derrick Henry and P Ryan Stonehouse ) during the game turned a possible win into an overtime defeat. While Henry and Simmons may have avoided serious injury, the Titans' fate appears sealed; even if they were to rip off five straight wins to close the season, they wouldn't be guaranteed a playoff spot . Questions now linger about the futures of Henry, Mike Vrabel and others in Tennessee. There's also still the matter of determining Will Levis ' upside heading into the offseason, which will be crucial for this suddenly reeling franchise."
2023,14,27,New York Jets,4-8,"When Aaron Rodgers said last week that it "" wouldn't make sense "" for him to attempt a late-season return if the Jets weren't contending, Sunday's matchup with the Falcons became the first of several must-win games -- and the Jets proceeded to lose, 13-8. It was the third defeat this season in which they held their opponent to 16 points or fewer, and it was their fifth straight loss overall after a 4-3 start. There are no signs Rodgers will start in Week 14 against the Texans, but a fourth Jets QB could. Trevor Siemian came in for an ineffective Tim Boyle and nearly matched Boyle's ineffectiveness. The Jets haven't officially been eliminated from a wild-card spot, but ... yeah, don't assume Rodgers is coming back to rescue this season. EDITOR'S UPDATE: NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported on Tuesday that the Jets are releasing Tim Boyle and signing quarterback Brett Rypien off the Seahawks' practice squad."
2023,14,28,New York Giants,4-8,"Rolling into the Week 13 bye with two straight victories made this a relatively quiet break by New York standards, but itâs not as if there arenât things to figure out by seasonâs end. First, the Giants have to decide whether to go with Tommy DeVito or Tyrod Taylor at quarterback now that Taylor has returned from IR . Then thereâs the state of the offensive line. The return of LT Andrew Thomas has given the team a lift, but it hasnât resulted in a huge offensive boost, and DeVito is still being sacked every five dropbacks or so. The Giants would love nothing more than for RT Evan Neal to show something down the stretch. Heâs been a liability at times when heâs played and seems like a possible candidate to kick inside if he doesnât improve as a pass blocker on the edge. EDITOR'S UPDATE: Giants coach Brian Daboll announced Tuesday that Tommy DeVito will remain the team's starter for Monday's game against the Packers ."
2023,14,29,Arizona Cardinals,3-10,"I admittedly did not think the Cardinals would just coast into their bye with a statement victory at Pittsburgh , but here we are. The game gives us another chance to praise Jonathan Gannon and the effort heâs coaxed out of this team. There have been significant tests along the way, and losing six straight in the middle of a season could break any teamâs spirit, no matter how young it is. That hasnât happened in Arizona, and it didnât happen on the road in a tough environment -- with two weather delays, to boot -- against a team scrapping for the playoffs . If Kyler Murray remains the Cardinals' quarterback next season, he might have something special brewing with security blanket Trey McBride . The tight end was a massive factor in the 99-yard, go-ahead TD drive and is heating up in Year 2 as one of Murrayâs most trusted targets."
2023,14,30,Washington Commanders,4-9,"Not too long ago, Sam Howell was looking like a pretty nice (and cost-effective) building block for the Commanders. And then he went out and threw a pick-six in three straight games, all Washington losses. Howell has only recorded one TD pass in that span, too, while Washington has fallen to 1-5 at home. Howell's athleticism, toughness and big-play ability are high notes in his game, but the turnover-worthy plays and sacks taken are just too plentiful now and must be weeded out next season, no matter who his coaches or teammates are. That's not excusing Washington's bad offensive line or the defense for putting Howell in some really tough spots, but it is the kind of stuff that could prevent him from nailing down the starting job for 2024 and beyond."
2023,14,31,New England Patriots,2-10,"The Patriots have held seven opponents to 24 points or fewer this season -- and they only won one of those games. That's not even the most amazing statistic related to this team's offensive stagnation. In their past three games, the Pats held each opponent to 10 or fewer points -- and they lost all three. Meanwhile, in Week 13 alone, three other NFL teams won games in which they allowed 28 points or more . At this point, it feels like you could put Mac Jones , Bailey Zappe , Malik Cunningham or even Steve Grogan out there at quarterback, and it likely wouldn't make a difference. Rhamondre Stevenson was hurt Sunday, and New England is already without multiple receivers, so a bad situation has somehow gotten worse. Even by early-1990s standards, this Patriots season has been dreadful."
2023,14,32,Carolina Panthers,1-11,"The Panthers became the first NFL team to be officially eliminated from postseason play, and you're now free to pour one out for them. Carolina actually led late in the third quarter Sunday -- for all of 10 game seconds -- before the Bucs hit the gas and took control. Like the Patriots, the Panthers have been in a season-long offensive slog. Unlike New England, however, Carolina remains clearly and deeply invested in its young quarterback. The remainder of the Panthers' season should be spent trying to build up Bryce Young 's confidence and effectiveness, with an eye on 2024 being his breakout year. Carolina can also try to play spoiler down the stretch, with games against all three NFC South opponents, plus the Packers and Jaguars, remaining on the schedule . Without a 2024 first-round pick on the horizon, the Panthers might as well go out and try to upset the apple cart."
2023,15,1,San Francisco 49ers,10-3,"The funny thing about Sunday's double-digit win over the rival Seahawks? San Francisco's offense was actually very hot and cold, looking mortal for stretches and then, BOOM! Someone just busts off a big play, and all is right in the 49ers' world. Brock Purdy held everything together. His INT could be blamed on Brandon Aiyuk , who also had a fumble later ... though the stud wideout did chip in 126 receiving yards. In fact, all of the Niners' top playmakers put up numbers, and Purdy's 54-yard TD pass to Deebo Samuel should end the silly narratives around the quarterback's downfield passing ability. If there was a worry coming out of the game, it was the shape of the defense. CB Charvarius Ward (groin), DT Javon Hargrave (hamstring) and LBs Dre Greenlaw (hip) and Oren Burks (knee) all left the game, with only Greenlaw re-entering. San Francisco was already playing without DT Arik Armstead , so if you're looking for an Achilles' heel on this juggernaut -- with Baltimore on tap in two weeks -- it might be this."
2023,15,2,Baltimore Ravens,10-3,"Lamar Jackson 's MVP campaign isn't hurting after his heroic effort against the Rams , which included a thrilling TD drive (with the scoring pass going to rookie WR Zay Flowers ) and successful two-point conversion (also thrown to Flowers ) to give the Ravens a late lead, before Tylan Wallace's pinch-hit punt-return TD ultimately sealed the deal in overtime. With the win and Miami's loss on Monday night, Baltimore owns the AFC's No. 1 overall seed while also leading the AFC North by two games, though Sunday wasn't easy. In fact, that was arguably the most this Ravens defense has been stressed all season -- as evidenced by the 37-31 final -- but there were enough big plays on that side not to stress too much about a unit that has played far more good football than bad. And Jackson helps widen the margin for error when he plays like he did in Week 14, stinging the Rams time and time again with his legs and arm. One way or another, we badly need a Joe Flacco -Lamar Jackson showdown in the playoffs. If the NFL scriptwriters are any kind of benevolent folk, they'll ensure this happens."
2023,15,3,Dallas Cowboys,10-3,"For a guy who was on the operating table a few days before, Mike McCarthy looked pretty healthy loping over to call timeout prior to the touchdown that gave Dallas a 24-6 halftime lead over rival Philadelphia. McCarthy called all the right shots in that opening half Sunday night, converting on a 60-yard field goal in the first quarter and successfully pulling off the rare TD-notching challenge at the goal line in the second quarter. Things simmered down after that, but in the end, the Cowboys sent a big message that they are indeed serious contenders for both the NFC East crown and the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC playoffs. This was the quality victory Dallas needed, but the next two are at Buffalo and at Miami , so the work isn't yet done, especially with the Eagles' remaining schedule a lot more favorable."
2023,15,4,Philadelphia Eagles,10-3,"Save for the end-of-game kneeldown by San Francisco in Week 13 , Philadelphia's defense allowed points on 10 consecutive drives (nine TDs and one field goal) for a stretch over the past two games. The Eagles gave themselves life in the third quarter against the Cowboys on Sunday night , forcing a Dak Prescott fumble and returning it for a touchdown . But Dallas had three takeaways of its own, stripping the Eagles' three best offensive playmakers: Jalen Hurts , A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith . In the first meeting with the Cowboys, the Eagles fumbled three times ... but recovered all three, allowing Philly to escape with a 28-23 win . Pummeled in the past two weeks, though, the Eagles are suddenly in danger of letting the division (and the No. 1 seed ) go to someone else. A year ago, the Eagles were playing their best ball with the playoffs looming. Now, they're just trying to weather the team's gauntlet of a schedule and get to the tournament. As things stand at the moment, they'd have to go to some southern city for the first round of the playoffs."
2023,15,5,Miami Dolphins,9-4,"For months, we've complained about the Dolphins not beating any quality teams. Now we can ding them for their stunning home loss to the Titans, who entered Monday with an 0-6 road record. Tyreek Hill 's ankle injury kept him off the field for a large chunk of the game, and Miami also lost C Connor Williams to a knee issue. But there's no excuse for losing to Tennessee after holding a 14-point lead with three minutes to go at home. The Dolphins' offense was just in a funk most of the night, factoring in the two gift touchdowns the Titans gave them via a muffed punt and a fumble . A Miami fumble and two field goals led to a 2-for-5 red-zone night, and the Dolphins had another field goal blocked . Then the Fins' defense, which had been so good all night, cracked on the final two drives, allowing Will Levis to march the Titans 75 and 64 yards to outscore Miami 15-0 in the final 160 seconds. It was just an ugly, ugly loss and a huge blow to the Dolphins' chances of earning the top seed ."
2023,15,6,Kansas City Chiefs,8-5,"When was the last time you heard Patrick Mahomes or Andy Reid challenge an official's (correct) call after a loss like they did on Sunday ? It felt strange, seeing two of the NFL's best competitors say that the referee needed to warn Reid about Kadarius Toney lining up offside when, really, the onus was on Toney to check with the line judge on that one. You want to gripe about the lack of a call late against the Packers? Be my guest. Have at it. But Sunday's grievance felt desperate and petty for a team that has been the league's preeminent organization over the past five years. To Reid's credit, he reversed course on Monday , saying it was indeed Toney's responsibility to check with the official. The bottom line is that Kansas City's problems go far beyond a few unfavorable calls here and there. Mahomes' opening-drive pick killed a promising march, and the reigning MVP's just not playing great ball right now. Neither is a defense that had carried this club for much of the season. The way things are trending, Mahomes might be staring at his first road playoff game."
2023,15,7,Detroit Lions,9-4,"Even at 8-2, the Lions gave us plenty of reasons to be concerned, from Jared Goff 's turnovers to the offensive line injuries and general defensive issues -- and none of those things have gotten better in the three games since. At 9-4, Dan Campbell's team is almost assured of earning a playoff bid, but Detroit logging its first postseason win since January of 1992 feels less likely by the day. There are still reasons for hope, and winning the division would help immensely, giving the Lions home-field advantage for at least one game. But they have allowed 26 or more points in five straight games and six of the past seven, struggling mightily with mobile quarterbacks throughout the season. When you look at the potential NFC playoff field, this is obviously a problem. The Lions need to find late-season answers in a hurry. Detroit looks nothing like it did earlier in the year."
2023,15,8,Cleveland Browns,8-5,"Joe Flacco went 18-3 against the Browns. For the Browns, he's now 1-1 with a tough loss that was much closer than the final score suggests. And Cleveland's going to ride him until the wheels fall off after the 38-year-old led four TD drives -- one in each quarter -- and the late field-goal march to seal a massive win over Jacksonville. His arm strength and touch on downfield passes have unlocked a chapter of the Browns' playbook that was too often overlooked this season. Flacco did turn the ball over twice with 14-point leads, possibly costing his own team points on both possessions, and Amari Cooper coughed up a fumble , too. But the Browns forced four Jaguars turnovers, converting the last two into second-half touchdowns. Even without star CB Denzel Ward , Cleveland's secondary stepped up, forcing three interceptions ( two by Martin Emerson Jr. ) and 22 incomplete passes -- with Browns defenders getting their hands on 10 of those throws. The playoffs look very likely, although all four remaining opponents continue to play hard and will be tough outs."
2023,15,9,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-5,"The Jaguars' defense is reeling, having allowed backup quarterbacks to dice them up two weeks in a row. First it was Jake Browning ; then Joe Flacco had his way with Mike Caldwell's defense. Outside of the strip sack , Jacksonville's pass rush was disappointing on Sunday, pressuring Flacco 12 times and hitting him thrice on 45 dropbacks. Sadly, the coverage and tackling were possibly worse. The offense certainly shares the blame with four turnovers, even though Trevor Lawrence gamely gutted through Week 14 with an ankle injury that many of us assumed would keep him out -- possibly for multiple weeks. But the QB's lack of chemistry with Calvin Ridle y (four catches on 13 targets) and Zay Jones (five on 14 targets) hurt the team, as did Doug Pederson's hyper-aggressive game-management approach late. As is the case with many other AFC teams, the Jaguars' postseason picture has changed dramatically in a matter of just two weeks, even with the Colts and Texans also losing Sunday."
2023,15,10,Buffalo Bills,7-6,"They might remain 11th in the AFC playoff pecking order , needing to pass four teams ahead of them right now, but the Bills remain a viable playoff contender at 7-6. Yes, Buffalo hosts red-hot Dallas this coming Sunday , must go on the road twice more and still has to face the Dolphins and Patriots, who beat the Bills in their first meeting . But the Bills earned a win at Arrowhead with Stefon Diggs having a poor outing by his standards (four catches, 24 yards) and with the defense being able to finish off the game, something it hasnât always done this season, even if it required a penalty to wipe out a Chiefs touchdown in the final minute-plus. Thereâs plenty to gripe about, but Josh Allen made some big throws and James Cook carried the offense with a strong effort. Fifteen touches for the second-year back feels too low; Cook needs 20 per game. The Bills are far from perfect, but they remain dangerous."
2023,15,11,Denver Broncos,7-6,"Somehow, some way, the Broncos only trail the Chiefs by one game in the AFC West -- and now, this Saturday's matchup in Detroit might not be as rough a road test as it might have looked a few weeks ago. Denver's defense took a tiny step back in the Week 13 loss to the Texans, but the Week 14 win over the Chargers was a huge statement performance. The Bolts turned the ball over twice, were stopped five times on fourth downs and were 0 for 12 on third downs, as Justin Herbert was knocked out of the game . The offense overcame some challenges, including a pick on Russell Wilson 's first pass of the game (which was actually Marvin Mims ' fault). That was the Broncos' first true turnover on an opening drive this season. They've mostly been very good, which makes their first-drive-of-the-second-half struggles perplexing. But otherwise, this team has been sneaky dangerous for a while, even if a lot of folks aren't ready to admit it."
2023,15,12,Houston Texans,7-6,"The Texans started Sunday without WR Tank Dell , TE Dalton Schultz and OT Tytus Howard ... and then left a 30-6 loss to the Jets with injuries to QB C.J. Stroud and WR Nico Collins . It was an all-around awful day for a team that has managed to avoid those most of the season. Houston has lost two of its last three games, making the road to the playoffs that much harder. The fact that Jacksonville and Indy also lost was a saving grace, but the Texans' injury situation clouds the forecast for this Sundayâs game in Nashville. This was the worst Houston looked offensively all season -- or, at the very least, since Week 1. The Texans' defense has been on its heels at times, but coming off a strong showing against the Broncos in Week 13, that unit should have played better against a Jets offense that hadnât looked very good over the past few months. Houston has shown ample improvement this season, but the young team could miss the playoffs now."
2023,15,13,Cincinnati Bengals,7-6,"The Bengals dominated a game against a playoff contender, and Jake Browning once again was terrific overall, even taking into account a poor pick-six that briefly gave the Colts life just before halftime. Browning has now led Cincinnati to two consecutive 30-point showings, which even Joe Burrow didn't manage to do this season. The return of Tee Higgins has clearly helped, but he and Ja'Marr Chase combined for just five catches Sunday. The Bengals leaned on a terrific screen game and continued to get tight end Tanner Hudson involved, as Browning connected on 18 passes to nine different pass catchers. It was also a good day for a beat-up Cincy defense, which may have had its best showing since October. That group entered the game 32nd in yards allowed per game, but kept the Colts to two gains longer than 16 yards on Sunday."
2023,15,14,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-6,"The Steelers made history on Thursday Night Football when they completed a two-game homestand of defeats against teams with 10-plus losses, according to NFL Research . On Sunday, they were rewarded by being bumped back into the playoff field -- for now, anyway. The Colts and Texans losing pushed the Steelers into the top seven on the AFC side, but those three are only half of the AFCâs six 7-6 teams currently. If thereâs a silver lining to the big picture, itâs that at least three of those teams are without their original starting quarterback now. The fact that Mitch Trubisky struggled the way he did against New England , compelling Steelers fans to demand an expeditious Kenny Pickett return, shows the level of desperation. Pittsburgh's playoff viability likely depends on the next two games, against the Colts and Bengals ."
2023,15,15,Indianapolis Colts,7-6,"Facing a Bengals team that had struggled to pass protect and stop the run coming in, the Colts figured to have a pretty good matchup as they continued their run for the postseason . But Indianapolis' pass rush and run game were nowhere to be found in Cincinnati, and the Colts committed a slew of unforced errors in the blowout loss . Indianapolis kept Bengals RBs Joe Mixon and Chase Brown more or less under wraps as runners, but each of them ripped off killer long screens . There were also special-teams gaffes that cost the Colts, including missed field-goal and extra-point tries and a muffed punt that led to a Cincy field goal. This is exactly the kind of sloppy ball that will leave you home come playoff time. Still, Indianapolis' schedule lines up pretty well, and the roster will be reinforced by the return of injured players. Will it be enough?"
2023,15,16,Green Bay Packers,6-7,"After all the highs of the previous three weeks, the Packers turned back the clock Monday night, reprising the kind of Jordan Love performance that had fans pulling their hair out before his recent hot streak. Entering the contest riding a three-game stretch of turnover-free football, Green Bay gave it up three times, with Love fumbling and throwing a pick in consecutive possessions. The quarterback was just in a funk most of the night, making some poor decisions and missing throws, leaving a lot of points on the field. Keisean Nixon's muffed punt in the third quarter set up a Giants TD , putting the Packers in chase mode. Love responded with two brilliant throws to Malik Heath late to take the lead, but the Packers' defense couldn't stop the Giants with less than two minutes left. How Green Bay didn't sack Tommy DeVito once is anyone's guess; Big Blue gave up an average of seven per game in the previous four."
2023,15,17,Minnesota Vikings,7-6,"Kevin O'Connell did not pull the bye-week trigger on a quarterback change -- but by the fourth quarter against the Raiders on Sunday, he'd seen enough, benching Joshua Dobbs for Nick Mullens . And it worked -- kinda. Mullens was a more efficient thrower down the stretch, and a field goal was all Minnesota needed in a 3-0 win . KOC now faces an interesting decision: Go back to Dobbs or give Mullens a shot? Like any good coach, he kept his options open, saying they're ""a week-to-week offense at this point,"" which is especially true with Justin Jefferson hurt again . But boy, this Vikings' defense is out to prove something. Ever since the Week 5 loss to the Chiefs, Brian Flores' group has been lights out. Shutouts are pretty darned rare; Minnesota's was just the fifth in the NFL this season, and there were only four in 2022. For that, the Vikings remain fascinating, warts and all. EDITOR'S NOTE: The Minnesota Vikings will start quarterback Nick Mullens against the Bengals on Saturday, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday."
2023,15,18,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,6-7,"Thatâs now two straight wins for the intrepid Buccaneers, living up to their name. They seldom make it easy, but somehow, Tampa Bay remains in the running for a home playoff game . Baker Mayfield had less than 100 yards passing heading into the fourth quarter, but he threw two TDs and led three second-half scoring drives to help the Bucs take control of the game late. Mayfield owed a debt of gratitude to the defense and special teams for keeping Tampa in the game, notching a safety while also forcing a near pick-six and two missed field goals in the first half. The defense suffered a few coverage busts, but made enough big plays to beat Atlanta and keep the season alive. The Bucs' chances of winning the division would have plummeted with a loss. Much left to do, but it was a critical step."
2023,15,19,Seattle Seahawks,6-7,"Theyâve lost four straight in 2023, five straight to the 49ers and now face an uphill battle to make the playoffs , with the Eagles coming to town this week and two more road games left. Seattle held Geno Smith out of this game so that he might have a chance to start against Philadelphia, but groin injuries can be tricky. Drew Lock looked pretty decent at times against the 49ers -- until the fourth quarter, that is. The return of Kenneth Walker III was positive, and he ripped off a 27-yard beauty of a catch-and-run, but the 'Hawks gave him just 12 touches. Even with some big plays, Seattle's defense (which lost CB Devon Witherspoon to injury ) was shredded again, allowing 527 yards and eight plays of at least 25 yards. Maybe Geno can rally the Seahawks against Philly, but right now, this team's on track to go from 6-3 back in Week 10 to out of the playoffs."
2023,15,20,Los Angeles Rams,6-7,"The Rams will look back at the missed opportunities in their valiant OT loss at Baltimore and weep, as they were unable to get stops on either Lamar Jackson âs late TD pass (on third-and-17) or the two-point conversion . The secondary had a rough day overall, allowing two busted-coverage TDs in the first half. The Ramsâ offense was mostly terrific, and Cooper Kupp had his biggest game in more than a month, but four straight second-half punts prevented Los Angeles from seizing control when given the chance. The Rams certainly rued the third-down sack Matthew Stafford took in that range of the game immediately after the Baltimore safety , knocking them out of field-goal range. L.A. can still get in the playoffs , and the remaining schedule isnât overwhelming, but this felt like a missed opportunity to steal one against a quality opponent."
2023,15,21,Atlanta Falcons,6-7,"A win would have put the Falcons a game ahead, with a 4-0 mark in the division, but thatâs all gone now. Two missed field goals and a safety put them in a first-half hole. Desmond Ridder had some terrific moments ( often when throwing to Drake London ) and some awful ones, specifically an INT deep in Falcons territory that turned into a Bucs touchdown and a missed layup TD throw to Bijan Robinson that forced Atlanta to settle for a field goal. Thankfully, the NFC South remains a morass, keeping Atlanta afloat. But how long can the Falcons sputter along this way? Theyâve tried a QB change; that didnât work. Theyâve mostly played good defense this year, even with Sundayâs late breakdowns. Yet their losses all feel similar, with drives unconverted and opportunities missed. If they fall short of the playoffs , we can easily point to why."
2023,15,22,New Orleans Saints,6-7,"Sundayâs win over lowly Carolina ended a three-game skid and gave the Saints a puncherâs chance at winning the NFLâs worst division this season. But the vibes around this team have felt pretty bleak for some time now, manifested in a Superdome crowd that was very much able to contain its enthusiasm as the Saints struggled to put away the Panthers. This is New Orleans. This is a problem. Then again, itâs hard to rev up the excitement, as Derek Carr âs arrival has failed to energize the offense. Carr and Erik McCoy , both team captains, were seen jawing at each other . We know Carr and his receivers havenât been on the same page often. Oh, and the run defense once again had a rough outing."
2023,15,23,Chicago Bears,5-8,"At a summer cookout, one of the other dads asked me how many games the Bears would win this season. I said âseven to nineâ felt reasonable. Of course, I ran into the same guy immediately after the 0-4 start, which made us both laugh. I hope I see him again soon. Since then, the Bears have gone 5-4 (including 2-2 with Tyson Bagent ) and have completely changed the arc of the season. Itâs wild to say aloud, but if they win the final four games, the Bears have a decent shot of making the playoffs . The defense did Sunday what it could not against the Lions in Detroit: close it out late. Justin Fields showed star potential at times against a beleaguered Lions defense, hitting D.J. Moore (who also had a rushing TD ) for a thrilling score on fourth-and-13 to pad the fourth-quarter lead. I presume the win also made it more likely that Fields, Matt Eberflus and Ryan Poles all are back next season for a team that suddenly has some serious momentum."
2023,15,24,Tennessee Titans,5-8,"Like Bob Dylan once sang, ""When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose."" Trailing by 14 late in the fourth quarter after a pair of brutal turnovers seemingly had handed the game to the Dolphins, the Titans stormed back to score a quick touchdown , and Mike Vrabel went for two ( and got it ), tickling the fancies of analytics people everywhere. After a quick three-and-out from Miami, Tennessee marched 64 yards in just four plays to score the go-ahead touchdown before snuffing out Miami's last-gasp drive. Vrabel let Will Levis gun it out on Monday night, and even with the rookie's two turnovers leading directly to 14 Dolphins points, he delivered some big-time plays in the stunning comeback victory . Levis threw for 327 yards, including 138 and his only TD pass in the fourth quarter. He also made a few scrambles and kept his composure, even when things went awry. There were few style points for the Titans in this one, but this was a Grade A spoiler job by Vrabel during his most frustrating season in Nashville. This has to be the most improbable victory of the entire regular season, given the late deficit, and a good response to the OT loss at home in Week 13."
2023,15,25,New York Jets,5-8,"Itâs hard to believe that Zach Wilson started the week with his coach knocking down a report that he was hesitant to reclaim the starting role and ended it with what might have been his best start in the NFL. Wilson lost a fumble up 14-0, temporarily letting the Texans back into the game, but that was about the only regrettable mistake from Wilson, who navigated the rainy conditions to throw for 209 yards and two TDs after halftime. All told, Wilson led three second-half TD drives despite Garrett Wilson being the only wide receiver with more than one reception Sunday . Iâm left to wonder: Could the Jets not have found ways to coax this level of play out of Wilson sooner? Did the benching motivate him properly? And what does this mean for Wilsonâs future? With the Jets likely to miss the playoffs, these are suddenly reasonable questions to mull."
2023,15,26,Los Angeles Chargers,5-8,"Everything went wrong Sunday -- and yes, I've written that before in this space, but this time I really mean it. The offensive line was worked over (six sacks allowed), Justin Herbert was taken out with a finger injury and the feisty fans busted out multiple âFire Staleyâ chants during the 24-7 loss to Denver , a game the Chargers never really threatened to win. It appears another season bearing so much hope is going to topple under its own weight. We know personnel changes are coming, with Austin Ekeler again hitting free agency and decisions to be made on some very pricey veterans. Itâs clear weâre heading toward an offseason where everyone not named Herbert has to feel at least a little bit uneasy about their role. They canât keep running things back with their talent. EDITOR'S UPDATE: NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported on Tuesday that Justin Herbert will miss the rest of the season following surgery to repair the broken index finger on his right (throwing) hand."
2023,15,27,New York Giants,5-8,"Undrafted rookie Tommy DeVito has become a folk sensation overnight because it's a cool story and everyone loves when the local kid does good. ""Tommy Cutlets"" left a little meat on the bone early Monday, doing almost as much with his legs through three quarters (71 rushing yards) as he did with his arm (99 passing yards). DeVito had his entire family kissing each other after his 26-yard run to the Green Bay 1-yard line, with the Giants taking their first lead of the game one play later. After DeVito delivered a perfect TD pass to Isaiah Hodgins to put the Giants up eight late in the third quarter, Green Bay stormed back to take the lead in the fourth. But then DeVito's 32-yard pass to Wan'Dale Robinson -- who had a huge night -- set up the game-winning kick . This game could serve as officiating teaching tape, from the Saquon Barkley fumble to the Malik Heath dropped TD and then the actual Heath TD . It was just one strange play after another in the final five-plus minutes. But DeVito's heroics and the Giants' third straight win have put a nice spin on an otherwise-tough season."
2023,15,28,Las Vegas Raiders,5-8,"In one of the sadder offensive games in recent memory, the Raiders were the team that lost . Fumbling in the red zone is seldom advised. A late-game interception also hurts, it turns out, as do five three-and-outs. You feel sick for the Raidersâ defense, which was causing all kinds of problems for the Vikings (five sacks for a whopping minus-47 yards) and running on fumes by the end. Itâs fair to wonder if Maxx Crosby should even be playing right now, but he had two of those sacks and supplied a ton of pressure. Unfortunately, Aidan OâConnell has underwhelmed, and the offensive line had a tough game Sunday, too. It was just an all-around deflating performance for a team trying to fight for its interim coach. Things are looking bleak."
2023,15,29,Arizona Cardinals,3-10,"It was a quality bye week, one would assume, for the Cardinals. They got to enjoy their road victory over the Steelers and then sit back and watch the Patriots and Jets both win, potentially helping their 2024 NFL Draft positioning . Arizona has two first-round picks, its own and Houstonâs. The Texans losing to the Jets damaged Houston's chances of making the postseason, and if it misses, the Cardinals would receive a top-18 pick. The Patriots and Cardinals both carry 3-10 records into the home stretch, and though the Pats currently hold the No. 2 overall pick, that easily could shift over the final month. But Jonathan Gannon has coached like a man who wants to win, so itâll be fascinating to see how competitive the Cards are in these remaining games."
2023,15,30,New England Patriots,3-10,"Itâs easy to say now, after their first win since Week 7, that the Patriots should have gone to Bailey Zappe earlier. I might have gone back as early as the Week 5 shutout loss to the Saints as the first time they reasonably could have (or should have) made a change. But then again, Zappe and Mac Jones are tied in home shutouts, 1-1, this season. Thatâs all a bunch of what-ifs now. The what-might-be could be more interesting. The ESPN College GameDay broadcast from Foxborough was manna from heaven for the tea-leaf readers of Patriots Nation, carefully parsing the words of Robert Kraft and Bill Belichick, as well as the specific wording of Pat McAfee . It was tremendous theater for those who like that sort of thing. And it also might mean less than nothing in the end, but itâs just another reminder that a few wins down the stretch might not alter the vector the coach and owner are on in a lost season."
2023,15,31,Washington Commanders,4-9,"No one reasonably could have expected defensive improvement following the trades of pass rushers Chase Young and Montez Sweat , but the unit underachieved prior to that, too, leading to the dismissal of defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and secondary coach Brent Vieselmeyer after the blowout loss to the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. According to Next Gen Stats, the Commanders have allowed 19 touchdowns on vertical routes this season, which is eight more than any other team. That is stunning for a franchise that entered this season with reasonable hopes of fielding a top-half defense with the potential to be a top-10 group. The Commanders finished the 2022 season with momentum and added talent this offseason, but the D regressed horribly. That, as much as anything, cratered Washingtonâs season, even if the offensive mistakes tend to earn more attention."
2023,15,32,Carolina Panthers,1-12,"Interim coach Chris Tabor vented after Carolina's sixth straight loss, its second such streak this season, and Bryce Young said he's also ""sick and tired"" of all the losing. Everyone is. And the thing is, the Panthers aren't even that inventive in their losses, as most share familiar themes. Close game. Good defense. Had a chance. Yada, yada. But it's true! The defense really has held up its end of the bargain more often than not, and for the first 55 minutes Sunday , it might have been the team's best defensive effort of the season. The run game was pretty productive (204 rush yards), but Young had maybe his worst start to a game this season, unable to get anything going beyond the short, quick stuff. Stop me if you've heard that before."
2023,16,1,San Francisco 49ers,11-3,"Itâs nice to have a solid but unremarkable showing and still beat a division foe on the road by 16 -- and it easily could have been more. The 49ers locked up the NFC West and are steamrolling toward the No. 1 seed in the conference. This coming Mondayâs game against the Ravens will be a terrific playoff tune-up, but the 49ers had better hope that DTs Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead can return from injury because the run defense was lacking in their absence against the Cardinals. Arizona ran for more than 100 yards in each half against the 49ers, with its two longest gains in the game -- 49 and 44 yards -- coming on the ground. Thatâs a significant part of Baltimoreâs formula for victory, so San Francisco has a chance to address one of the few big concerns with the team prior to the postseason."
2023,16,2,Baltimore Ravens,11-3,"Somehow, Lamar Jackson âs value to this team went up Sunday night , as the Ravens weathered a tight first half and pulled away late. Jackson was great again, but the season-ending knee injury to Keaton Mitchell , who had carved out an important role over the last two months, is pretty notable. The offense still has some threats, but on Sunday evening, Odell Beckham Jr. had as many drops as catches (one apiece), while Zay Flowers was held to one reception. That wonât happen most games, and tight end Isaiah Likely stepped up with a big performance, but it does highlight the fact that the Ravens arenât exactly teeming with playmakers with TE Mark Andrews and Mitchell out. But then again, Baltimore has a strong defense led by DT Justin Madubuike , who has been an absolute beast. Even with injuries, this is a strong roster and a balanced operation. Monday's showdown with the 49ers will be a terrific measuring-stick game, with both teams headed to the playoffs ."
2023,16,3,Dallas Cowboys,10-4,"Prior to kickoff in Buffalo, the Cowboys secured a playoff spot . Unfortunately, that ended up being the high point of Sunday. Losing to the Bills was never going to kill the season and all the positive momentum of the past few months, but it was the way it happened that raised some serious concerns . Giving up 266 yards and three TDs on the ground to Buffalo revealed what could be the blueprint to beating Dallas in the playoffs. DT Johnathan Hankins was missing for this game, but itâs wild to think he was the difference. In the Cowboysâ four losses this season, theyâve allowed 767 rush yards on 153 carries (5.0 average) and nine TDs. In their 10 wins, opponents have run the ball 232 times for 877 yards (3.8 average) and only four TDs. This weekâs opponent, Miami , can run it. So can Detroit, Dallas' Week 17 assignment . These are critical games for a team that still is jockeying for the No. 1 seed, yet suddenly it faces a major issue that is threatening to challenge the whole operation. The Cowboys shouldnât have lost Sunday's game as one-sidedly as they did."
2023,16,4,Miami Dolphins,10-4,"The Dolphins' bizarre Week 14 loss to the Titans still stings, but Sunday's dismantling of the Jets was a welcome response from a team that has a contender's record but faces plenty of questions about its credentials among the top tier. It was a big game for Tua Tagovailoa and Jaylen Waddle , who showed the offense could hold its own without Tyreek Hill and with the Jets taking away Miami's run game. But there was an even bigger statement from a defense that has lost multiple starters to injury in recent weeks. Even against a feckless Jets offense, allowing a net of 4 first-half yards (and only 103 for the game) was the kind of performance this group needed heading into a closing stretch against three heavyweights: Dallas , Baltimore and Buffalo , the last of which could decide the AFC East in Week 18. We've been begging for a quality victory this season. Here is Miami's chance."
2023,16,5,Philadelphia Eagles,10-4,"Jalen Hurts was playing after dealing with an illness , Matt Patricia was taking over defensive play-calling duties from Sean Desai and the Eagles were facing a desperate Seattle team on the road , so there were some tangible hurdles to overcome on Monday night. But Philadelphia was also taking on a backup quarterback, and the Eagles certainly knew how big this game was. For the first 58-ish minutes, Patricia's defense responded in a big way with Darius Slay out, allowing 205 yards in Philly's best effort in months. The final two minutes didn't go as well, with Drew Lock driving 92 yards for the go-ahead TD and Hurts being picked for a second time in a nightmare of a fourth quarter. This wasn't the catastrophe of a loss that some will make it out to be. Had the Eagles won, I might have bumped them over Dallas. Instead, they slipped a little. They're still in decent shape to take the NFC East, but the defensive issues haven't gone away."
2023,16,6,Kansas City Chiefs,9-5,"This didnât feel like a great win , no matter how you spin it. Yes, Bill Belichick has a good record vs. Andy Reid. Yes, it was in New England. And yeah, the Patriots were coming off a rare win . But they have been a bad team far more than a good one this season, and the Chiefs almost let them back in the game late despite New England moving the ball more than 29 yards on a drive only twice. Kadarius Toney had another maddening mistake, dropping a pass that led to a pick . Itâs like Week 1 all over again, and it came on the heels of Toney's infamous offensive offside penalty . Travis Kelce dropped a TD. Rashee Rice had a big game, but also had a critical penalty early. The running backs in place of Isiah Pacheco and the defense were Kansas Cityâs saviors in another game lacking in artistic merit."
2023,16,7,Detroit Lions,10-4,"This was the get-right game the Lions needed, and even though it was a slog early on against the Broncos , it was also poetic. It required the defense, which had taken its share of lumps in recent games, to hold its water early as the offense was getting preheated in the first quarter. But even as the defense softened a bit, Jared Goff and Sam LaPorta eventually got it going with three TD connections, and Jahmyr Gibbs showed just how potent he can be when he gets in a groove. It was a stunning display of offensive prowess after that unit had been waning of late, especially considering it came against a Denver defense that was among the leagueâs better units in recent weeks. Now the Lions are tantalizingly close to the postseason bid they narrowly missed out on last year. Their issues might not be magically cured, but theyâre a lot less concerning now."
2023,16,8,Buffalo Bills,8-6,"After James Cook sidewinded his way through the Cowboysâ defense for his second touchdown of the day early in the fourth quarter, FOXâs Greg Olsen perfectly summed up these current Bills: âIn the event this team makes the playoffs, I donât care if theyâre the four seed, the seven seed -- I donât think it matters. I donât know anybody in the AFC that feels good coming here or having the Bills [come to their house].â At 6-6, Buffalo was left for dead. At 8-6, this team looks like a frightening party crasher. The Bills are not yet in the dance, though, sitting in the No. 9 slot in the AFC. But their ranking here reflects just how dangerous this team is right now after stomping a Cowboys club that had won five straight, beating those opponents by an average of more than 23 points. Miami had better hope it clinches the AFC East before it faces the Bills in Week 18 ."
2023,16,9,Cleveland Browns,9-5,"While Joe Flacco struggled through his worst game with Cleveland, the Browns rode their dominant defense. Justin Fields stung them a few times early, and Flacco's first two picks led to 14 points, but the Browns clamped down when they needed to. Several defensive reserves made game-changing plays amid a slew of injuries , and the offense finally woke up late, despite the Bears swallowing up their run game and despite the offensive line taking another hit with the loss of LG Joel Bitonio . TE David Njoku scored the Browns' first points with less than 5 minutes left in the second quarter. When Cleveland tried to go back to Njoku in the end zone late in the third quarter, Flacco's pass was intercepted . But from that point on, Njoku dominated. He caught six passes for 86 yards in the fourth quarter, including a 34-yard catch-and-run that set up the game-winning field-goal -- and atoned for a costly offside penalty with less than two minutes left. It was yet another miracle finish in Cleveland. How the Browns are doing this is anyone's guess."
2023,16,10,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-6,"They made a host of errors early against the Ravens and ended up leaving 13 points on the board by halftime -- two missed field-goal attempts and a potential touchdown blown at the end of the second quarter due to poor clock management and execution. It capped a wicked three-game losing streak for the see-saw franchise, replete with ill-timed penalties, mental lapses and blown assignments. Now a three-game divisional lead is gone. Trevor Lawrence has shown incredible toughness in not missing a single start -- even when it looked dicey twice this season. But he had some regrettable errors against Baltimore, coughing up an unforced fumble in the red zone (one of two in the game) and mishandling the late first-half possession, stalling out inside the 5-yard line as the clock ran out. The questions are mounting in Jacksonville."
2023,16,11,Houston Texans,8-6,"After Sunday's overtime win over the Titans, with Case Keenum stepping in for C.J. Stroud , all possibilities exist for the Texans: win the AFC South, make the playoffs as a wild-card team or miss the postseason tournament entirely. At this moment, they're one spot out , ahead of Buffalo in the AFC wild-card picture but behind both the Colts and Jaguars in the AFC South race. ""Gritty"" might be one way to describe Sunday's win; ""fortunate"" might be another. The Titans raced to a 13-0 lead, and Houston kept settling for field goals and enduring long offensive droughts. The absence of Stroud, Nico Collins and Tank Dell clearly hurt, but Devin Singletary had a huge outing, and Noah Brown and Dalton Schultz both made game-changing catches. The Texans' defense also deserves major kudos for holding Tennessee to 204 total yards and three second-half points without Will Anderson Jr. and Blake Cashman playing. But the real test comes Sunday against Cleveland , with Stroud Watch kicking into high gear this week."
2023,16,12,Cincinnati Bengals,8-6,"The Bengals are reinventing winning through adversity, finding new ways each week. Saturdayâs wild comeback , spurred by Tee Higgins â Catch of the Year candidate to tie it late, was just the latest chapter -- and another unexpected one A.B. (After Burrow). Jake Browning started slow but ended up with 324 passing yards. He led three fourth-quarter touchdown marches and an overtime field-goal drive (without JaâMarr Chase ) to complete the comeback. Have you stuck with Cincy on this yearâs wild ride? From Super Bowl expectations to early-season struggles to beating the 49ers by two TDs to losing Joe Burrow to winning three straight and entering Week 16 as the AFCâs No. 6 seed . Chase is now likely to miss some time with a shoulder injury , which feels like just the next hurdle to overcome."
2023,16,13,Indianapolis Colts,8-6,"With the playoffs potentially hanging in the balance, the Colts received notable contributions from D.J. Montgomery , Tyler Goodson and Trey Sermon -- none of whom were on the roster a few months ago. Most of it happened after the Steelers built a 13-0 lead, too, but the Colts werenât at all spooked. It was a terrific answer after the second-half performance in the loss to the Bengals. Now we wait to hear about the Michael Pittman Jr. (concussion) and Zack Moss (arm) injuries suffered in the win, plus any updates on Jonathan Taylor âs status . But this was low key a massive game for Gardner Minshew . He has battled all season and kept the team competitive, with Indianapolis going 6-4 in his starts and 2-0 when replacing Anthony Richardson midgame. Yet Minshew had been a bit erratic and mistake-prone before Saturday, which is why his three-TD performance was a confidence builder. His passing stats (18-of-28, 215 yards) weren't eye-popping, but it felt like his best game of the season."
2023,16,14,Denver Broncos,7-7,"The midgame squabble was the big moment in the Broncosâ blowout loss at Detroit, and Sean Payton seemed to pour kerosene on the fire when answering questions about it after the game. Even through the Broncosâ baptismal hot streak, winning six of seven coming into Week 15, most of the games were tight and tense, and itâs never quite felt like Payton has welcomed Russell Wilson into the Circle of Trust. It felt like Payton took out his frustration over a tough penalty that wiped out a touchdown on Wilson, but perhaps itâs much ado about nothing. What appears more concerning is that, even with three winnable games remaining, the Broncos are on the outside looking in for the playoffs after being dominated from the second quarter on against the Lions."
2023,16,15,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,7-7,"This was their biggest win of the season, and it was Baker Mayfield âs best game as a Buccaneer. Heâs played gamely all year, but the results have been uneven at times. Mayfield led the Bucs to two nail-biter wins prior to Green Bay, but completed 48.3 percent of his passes in both of them. Sunday against the Packers , he was a stunning 22-of-28 passing for 381 yards -- the most since his rookie season -- and four TDs. Each TD pass went to a different receiver, and Chris Godwin had a monster game to kick this offense into another gear. The late touchdown drive to ice the contest felt like a graduation of sorts. It ended the Packersâ threat, pushed the Bucs to a season-best 452 yards and gave them their highest point total in a win. They lost 39-37 to Houston earlier this season, back when the Bucs were in the throes of their late-game woes. Have the past few games exorcized those demons?"
2023,16,16,Los Angeles Rams,7-7,"The offense and defense sort of yinged and yanged with how each unit played, as Los Angeles got out to a 20-0 lead early in the second half before having to hang on to win, 28-20 . It was by no means a dominant performance against a bad Commanders team, but the job was done. The Rams also got some help from old friend Baker Mayfield , and with Carolina beating Atlanta , L.A. would be in good shape with two more victories. Up next are the Saints and Giants , two winnable games -- but also two games in which the Rams have to mind their Ps and Qs. Theyâve gone 4-1 since the bye, with two statement wins, two close wins and one respectably close loss to the Ravens . But Sunday was a reminder that early mistakes, such as fumbles and red-zone errors, can open the door for lesser teams to steal a game. The Rams are not dominant, but they are well-coached and suddenly quite competitive."
2023,16,17,Seattle Seahawks,7-7,"The Seahawks remain alive in the playoff hunt thanks to Drew Lock 's first game-winning drive in more than three years. Lock got word he was starting before kickoff, played a mostly smart and safe game (even with a late sack that almost cost him) and then delivered the dream drive of his career: 92 yards, 10 plays, 84 seconds. Things were looking a little dicey, but Lock delivered twice on third-and-10 -- first for 34 yards to DK Metcalf , then for 29 more on the gorgeous TD pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba . The Seahawks couldn't get much going early on offense, but they just kept grinding away, holding the Eagles in check defensively. Lock got emotional afterward when talking about his opportunity, and Pete Carroll was in rare form celebrating his team and his QB, even if Geno Smith is expected back in the saddle this Sunday. No matter. The Seahawks rediscovered a little mojo Monday."
2023,16,18,Minnesota Vikings,7-7,"The standings and schedule seem to suggest that the Vikings have a statistically decent chance of making the postseason. But the quarterback regression is undeniable now; even Kevin OâConnell has called it a âweek-to-weekâ operation, and I know exactly what he means. Joshua Dobbs gave the team a jolt, and then he crashed. Nick Mullens started Saturday and looked poised to deliver a huge road win. Instead, he finished with two picks deep in Cincinnati territory ( one to a 311-pound defensive tackle ) and should have thrown a pick-six, but the Bengals jumped offsides. That and a strange, late collapse by Minnesotaâs vastly improved defense did the Vikings in. This team sure could use a guy like Jake Browning ! (Different context, but this joke reminds me of the line from Major League when the pitching coach says, âWish we had him two years ago,â to which the GM responds: âWe did.â)"
2023,16,19,Green Bay Packers,6-8,"Packers fans have had a complicated relationship with their defensive coordinators over the years, but Joe Barry has become the center of focus for their ire during Green Bayâs two-game slide (and even at points before that). The problems with the run defense have been debated ad nauseum, but Sunday provided a new talking point, as Baker Mayfield carved up the Packersâ secondary. Pair that with the late-game breakdowns defensively against the Giants , and you can see why the Packersâ chances of making the playoffs have sunk like a stone over the past week-plus. Offensively, it has not been perfect, and Matt LaFleur has not had a healthy backfield in a long time, but he also hurt the Packersâ chances by calling a bizarre challenge in the fourth quarter when it wasnât needed and settling for a field goal before watching Tampa Bay score a touchdown on the following drive to put it away. Itâs looking like this valiant run at the postseason might come up just a bit short."
2023,16,20,Pittsburgh Steelers,7-7,"Saturdayâs loss was pretty much a deathblow to Pittsburgh's season, even if we should have known which way the wind was blowing after back-to-back home losse s to 2-10 teams . This might temporarily boost Kenny Pickett âs stock; after all, everything started really spiraling out of control after he got hurt. But I donât think Pickett was going to rescue this team, as his limitations were part of the Steelersâ offensive issues to begin with. The defense might have carried this squad to the seven wins, but itâs falling apart at the wrong time, especially in the secondary . This season started with playoff hopes, but there was always a smoke-and-mirrors quality to the wins and a stark reality in the losses, including three early-season beatdowns and three late-season breakdowns."
2023,16,21,New Orleans Saints,7-7,"Sunday's victory marks a second straight comfortable win at home, but how much have we learned about New Orleans in that span? Similar to Week 14's game against Carolina, the Saints didn't make it a two-score lead until late in the third quarter, and that was after Giants QB Tommy DeVito had to leave for a short spell. But it was a positive development that Derek Carr had his cleanest, most efficient game in some time -- and it came without WR Chris Olave or RT Ryan Ramczyk . Carr completed 23 of his 28 passes, and even with punts on three of the first four drives, the Saints showed better rhythm offensively. They also didn't hurt themselves with turnovers, red-zone collapses or penalties, even with two flags stalling one promising drive in the first half. That and a dominant defensive performance (seven sacks, 2-of-16 from the Giants on third down) was enough to keep New Orleans in the division hunt."
2023,16,22,Atlanta Falcons,6-8,"The wild thing is, if they win out, the Falcons probably make the playoffs . But asking them to string together three straight victories -- something they've never done with Arthur Smith as head coach -- despite two of those three games being on the road (where they're 2-5) feels a little like slipping ""Escalade"" onto your Santa list the night before Christmas. I mean, miracles do happen and all that, but seldom do they occur after such soul-stealing events as we witnessed Sunday . One agonizing possession after the next, I kept saying, This is where they turn the game around, right up until Desmond Ridder 's late pick . I should have known. Even from his college tape, Ridder's ceiling has always felt clear to me, but I gave him credit for authoring game-winning drives in five of his first 11 NFL starts. Since then, Ridder has lost and regained his starting job, with his completion percentage going down and his INT percentage rising. And now the 24-year-old signal-caller is hitting the bench once again, as NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that Taylor Heinicke will start Sunday's game against the Colts ."
2023,16,23,Las Vegas Raiders,6-8,"The best way to rebound from a shutout , they say, is dropping a nine-TD bomb on your opponent four days later. From (tied with) the fewest points scored to the most for the franchise ever, all in an 80-hour span. The Raiders are nominally in the playoff race , but they need a perfect finish and a bunch of other things to happen to get in. But what that 63-21 game told us was that Las Vegas has some young playmakers to keep eyes on. Aidan OâConnell did all he could to fend off Jimmy Garoppolo and give himself a chance to compete for the starting job next season. Tre Tucker woke up in a big way with a two-TD game after being held scoreless previously. TE Michael Mayer , who had a touchdown , has started to impact games more. Dylan Parham kicked in to center (in place of Andre James ) and Thayer Munford moved to left tackle (with Kolton Miller out), paving the way for RB Zamir White , subbing for an injured Josh Jacobs . All encouraging developments."
2023,16,24,Chicago Bears,5-9,"The defense has been on a turnover tear over the past four games, forcing 14 of them. Chicago had three interceptions of Joe Flacco on Sunday , with one pick-six and another INT returned to the Cleveland 1-yard line, to bring its season total to 18 (second only behind the 49ers). Despite that, three sacks and a complete erasure of Clevelandâs run game, however, the Bears couldnât protect a 17-7 lead entering the fourth quarter. Justin Fields had 21 incompletions and was 7-for-19 passing for 65 yards after halftime. He also had a Hail Mary interception at the end of each half. The second one landed in the lap of Darnell Mooney for what could have been a game-winning touchdown, but the Bears wideout couldnât secure it, and the ball ended up in the hands of the Brownsâ DâAnthony Bell . The brief flirtation with the playoffs isnât mathematically dead, but the playoffs arenât exactly flirting back, if you catch my drift."
2023,16,25,Tennessee Titans,5-9,"The loss officially knocked them out of the postseason, but even with the upset win at Miami in Week 14, the Titans weren't realistically making the playoffs this year. Too many things went wrong in the 3-7 start, which proved to be too big a hole from which to reemerge. Will Levis still has plenty to work on, but his steady improvement since earning the starting job has been tangible. I think heâs at least given himself the chance to compete for the starting role in 2024, if not be the favorite come August. The appeal is obvious: Heâs young, cheap and talented. The Titans should be in terrific shape, salary cap-wise , to spend money this offseason and fix the problem areas, and theyâre in line for a top-10 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. If Derrick Henry has more 16-carry, 9-yard types of games down the stretch, he might not be part of the rebuild . This is a pretty interesting team for a variety of reasons -- among them, whoâll be back and who wonât -- as the offseason draws closer."
2023,16,26,New York Jets,5-9,"The Jetsâ season has been another failed mission, and yet weâve sort of stuck around after the Aaron Rodgers injury because of these weird teasers along the way that maybe things could be better. Beating the Bills without Rodgers Week 1. The three-game win streak, including the victory over the Eagles . The slim possibility that Rodgers might return. The blowout win over the playoff-hungry Texans in Week 14. Those kept hope afloat. But itâs perhaps fitting that the Jets were officially eliminated from the postseason with Sundayâs 30-0 loss , just as Rodgers is being cleared for the next stage in his comeback . Itâs as if a higher power was shouting âNoooo!â from elsewhere in the cosmos, a guardian spirit desperately trying to prevent this team from doing more self-damage. The season is now fully cooked, so the Jets canât hurt you or themselves any more. Changes are certainly coming next year, and how deeply theyâll cut might not become clear for a few weeks, but this game was an awful rÃ©sumÃ©-builder for Robert Saleh."
2023,16,27,Los Angeles Chargers,5-9,"It doesnât feel like the Chargers wanted to make an in-season firing , but last weekâs thrashing by the Raiders necessitated a move on head coach Brandon Staley and GM Tom Telesco. It just wasnât working, pretty much from the playoff meltdown last January on, but there were signs before that, too. The entire season is a loss now, with several key players now facing offseason rehab, including QB Justin Herbert . Having Herbert in tow for the prime years of his career will add to the appeal of the job, and the roster isnât in awful shape, even with some major contract decisions looming. The Bolts are also cruising toward a top-10 pick in April, and if this season has shown us anything, itâs that Patrick Mahomes might not be immortal. Even still, those are wound-licking consolations right now that the Chargers hope might, mercifully, pay off one day."
2023,16,28,New York Giants,5-9,"Hard to ding Tommy DeVito too much for Sundayâs loss , as the offensive line reverted to some old bad habits and his wide receivers did next to nothing for him when it was still a close game. DeVito probably was responsible for a few of the seven sacks, but he took some hard hits (one on which led to him being tested for a concussion) and kept battling throughout. Heâs positioning himself to be at least the favorite to be QB2 behind Daniel Jones next season, and nothing that happened Sunday should undercut that. It was good to see Darren Waller back and making an impact, but contributions from WanâDale Robinson and Jalin Hyatt have varied wildly week to week. Itâd be nice if the Giants could showcase those two young wideouts down the stretch."
2023,16,29,Arizona Cardinals,3-11,"In spite of losing by 19 and 16 points in the two matchups against the 49ers this season, there were clear positives to be taken from each game, starting with the 399 yards of offense the Cardinals averaged. They threw for 257 yards in the first outing (without Kyler Murray ) and ran for 234 in the second. Before the first meeting against the 49ers next season, Arizona might want to refurbish its defense. That unit ranks dead last in Next Gen Statsâ defensive success percentage at 49.7 -- where the league average is 56.2 percent, and six teams are operating at over a 60 percent rate. The Cardinals are close to the bottom in pressure percentage (31.1) and are tied with the Vikings for the highest completion percentage against (69.6). Jonathan Gannon is a defensive guy, and heâs gotten his team to play hard in Year 1, but the next step for improvement is clear, otherwise the Cardinals wonât be able to beat teams such as the 49ers."
2023,16,30,New England Patriots,3-11,"Had Bailey Zappe kept up a respectable first-half performance against the Chiefs , piggybacking off the win over the Steelers , perhaps weâd have something to talk about. Well, Zappe threw a bad interception that never should have gone to where it did, and the Patriotsâ self-inflicted errors (often penalties wiping out big plays) did them in, despite New England forcing three Kansas City turnovers and briefly making it a competitive game late. We can certainly turn our attention to the 2024 NFL Draft, where the Patriots currently sit in the No. 2 slot , with the 3-11 Cardinals selecting third. The Panthers winning their second game of the season at least opened the door slightly for New England to slide into the top spot. But Bill Belichick has coached to win games and isnât stopping, so the Pats just as easily could slide out of the top five with eight other teams sitting at 5-9 or worse."
2023,16,31,Washington Commanders,4-10,"First-half Sam Howell was 7-for-16 passing for 52 yards, and the Commanders trailed 13-0 at the break. Then, after an impressive TD drive, Howell had a three-and-out and an interception and was pulled with Washington down 28-7 for Jacoby Brissett , who brought the team back late Sunday . Howellâs season has been a strange one, with some truly impressive streaks and production for a first-year starter. His toughness and guts to attempt difficult throws canât be overlooked, and heâs clearly flashed a playmaking knack. But thereâs no chance, no matter who the head coach is, that Washington goes into next season with only Howell and Brissett (or a similar-caliber player) vying for the starting job. Maybe itâs a young benched starter from elsewhere or a draft pick, but Howell will be better served if he is truly pushed. Plus, not knowing what kind of an offense the 2024 Commanders might run, Howell isnât talented or efficient enough yet to be anointed into any role for next year."
2023,16,32,Carolina Panthers,2-12,"Kudos to interim coach Chris Tabor (whoâs a witty guy and a good football coach) on Dub No. 1 . He has a unique chance to pad his win total as a first-time head coach and sting his former employer. The Bears currently own Carolinaâs No. 1 overall pick in the draft, but another win -- with suddenly shaky Green Bay and Jacksonville up next on the schedule -- and the Panthers could shift the top of the draft order completely, with the 3-11 Patriots and Cardinals nipping close behind. And win No. 2 for Bryce Young was mildly encouraging, highlighted by zero turnovers and a clock-draining, game-winning, 90-yard drive in the rain against a desperate team. The Panthers should have money to spend this offseason, and owner David Tepper is extremely eager to win, so imagining the Young we saw Sunday getting better blocking and having improved targets puts a positive (but realistic) spin on things."
2023,17,1,Baltimore Ravens,12-3,"A million things happened afterward, but I thought the Ravens showed a lot of early poise following a pretty shaky start against the 49ers. Kicking off the Brock Purdy pick party in the end zone was a strong response, but the defense bent a few times early and the offense opened with a three-and-out and then an unfortunate, ref-induced safety . From there on, though, it was a Baltimore onslaught that ended with a 33-19 road win . The Ravens have passed a number of mental-toughness tests this season, and we saw them check the box on two more Monday night: stemming the tide early in a hostile environment and then making a tremendous goal-line stand in the final few minutes to shut the door on any miracle-comeback possibility for the Niners. Lamar Jackson played such a cool, composed game, even if the Ravens might've taken their foot off the gas a bit early. It certainly tilted the MVP debate in Jackson's favor on a night when his biggest competition threw four picks and was knocked out of the game . But do not overlook the reason for Purdy's nightmare outing: a swarming, relentless Baltimore defense."
2023,17,2,San Francisco 49ers,11-4,"Even though the 49ers saved face a bit late in the 33-19 loss to the Ravens, it's impossible to overlook how tough a night Brock Purdy and several elements of the offense had. On the first interception , Purdy forced it in the end zone -- bad decision. The second one was a terrific defensive play by Brandon Stephens (and Marlon Humphrey ). No. 3 was all on Purdy, even if it was a fluky play because he saw two flags fly in front of his face before the throw. Purdy's arm was hit on the fourth one , but by that point, the Ravens had landed enough haymakers to make the debate a pretty moot one. It was just a lump of coal all around. San Francisco's offensive line got manhandled after a certain point. The tackling was atrocious for a stretch. It just was not the game I expected from this team at this point in the season. But the Niners have stumbled before and risen again, and I believe they'll be in the thick of the Super Bowl race, especially with the NFC's top seed still very much in play."
2023,17,3,Miami Dolphins,11-4,"The Dolphins did what weâve been begging them to do all season long: beat a quality team. The 22-20 win over Dallas came in Miami, but the fact is the Fins went toe-to-toe with a good squad and prospered in a tense, playoff-like environment. They needed every Jason Sanders bomb to get it done, but the key play might have been the third-and-2 conversion with just under two minutes remaining in the game. Running the football has been the Dolphinsâ sneaky superpower this season when theyâve had their full offensive personnel on the field, and though they did not spring a lot of big runs Sunday, they finished off the important ones. This now sets up a potential division-clinching game against the Ravens , which just so happens to be another terrific playoff table setter. Miami has responded beautifully after Week 14's shocking loss to Tennessee."
2023,17,4,Philadelphia Eagles,11-4,"The Cowboys lost and the Eagles won , ending their three-game slide, so the bottom line is that it was a productive weekend. The division title moved closer to landing in Philadelphia, with two winnable games remaining ( vs. Cardinals , at Giants ). But Monday's victory over the Giants was fairly unimpressive on the whole. The Eagles nearly coughed up a 20-3 lead to a team that benched its quarterback midgame because the offense was struggling. Philly's special teams turnover was a bit fluky, and while Dallas Goedert fell down on Jalen Hurts ' pick-six, Hurts was lucky he didn't throw an interception on the play just before it, too. The Eagles outgained the Giants by nearly 200 yards, but all the mistakes made it a close game that came down to the final play . They'll want to knock those off as much as possible before the playoffs, one could safely assume."
2023,17,5,Detroit Lions,11-4,"You just knew the Lions' first NFC North title -- which will give them their first home playoff game in 30 years -- wouldn't come easily. They had to fight and scrap for every drive in the thrilling win over the Vikings, benefiting greatly from four Nick Mullens interceptions (all of them on deep balls). But the Lions also deserve credit for those defensive stops, even if their down-to-down consistency was lacking and they had few answers for Justin Jefferson . Could they stand to tighten up on defense? Uh-huh. Will they take the game-changing turnovers, even while allowing chunks of yards? Absolutely. It also helps that the offense has multiple playmakers capable of being showcased in any given game. Rookie RB Jahmyr Gibbs atoned for his early fumble with 100 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns, as he and WR Amon-Ra St. Brown took over in the second half. A special season in Detroit will be extended by at least one game in January."
2023,17,6,Dallas Cowboys,10-5,"They already clinched a playoff spot somewhat anticlimactically , but a division title might not be in the cards after Sundayâs loss in Miami. If thatâs the case, the Cowboys will have to find a way to pull off three straight postseason road wins to finally make that elusive return to the Super Bowl. Theyâre good enough to get there at their best, and the 'Boys did rip off five straight wins in impressive fashion not that long ago. But converting third downs consistently has proven to be problematic in most of Dallas' five road losses, and the offense went just 1-for-3 in the red zone at Miami, with the opening-drive first-and-goal fumble giving the Dolphins a huge early momentum swing. The offense did atone late with the epic, 17-play, go-ahead TD drive, but the defense couldnât finish it off after playing well most of the second half."
2023,17,7,Buffalo Bills,9-6,"I hedged a bit last week, placing the Bills in the No. 8 spot -- and boy , did I hear about it. Some readers wanted them at No. 2! I wasn't about to do that, and Saturday's struggle against the Chargers was a reminder of how off they've been at various times this season. It might not be the start of a trend, but it's not exactly the kind of performance that boosts confidence in the big picture. Second-year back James Cook went from season-saving hero to fumble-prone concern in the span of a week. Buffalo's defense came up with timely plays from Ed Oliver , Rasul Douglas and Taron Johnson . And when he needed to be, Josh Allen was money. But it's like I tell my kids all the time: It doesn't have to be that difficult. That said, the Bills are never boring! With the playoffs still hanging in the balance, expect a few more plot twists before it's all said and done."
2023,17,8,Cleveland Browns,10-5,"Whatâs prettier than a Joe Flacco deep ball? Sure, he got picked twice on those in Sunday's first half, but neither hurt very much, as the miracle Browns drove for three first-half touchdowns and stuffed their fansâ stockings with two more to start the second half in a 36-22 win at Houston. Granted, the Texans were fielding a battered lineup against them, but seeing Flacco and Amari Cooper (who racked up an incredible 265 yards receiving and two TDs) hook up time and time again was good enough for me to think Cleveland could be a real problem in the playoffs. The Dustin Hopkins injury is one to watch, though, as he has been so money for the Browns all season. But even with the questions, this team has a big-play operation on offense and one of the five best defenses -- if not the best -- in the league. Thatâs what makes Cleveland dangerous, even if it has to open the playoffs on the road."
2023,17,9,Kansas City Chiefs,9-6,"This looks like a broken team in some ways. How else do you explain losing to an opponent whose quarterback had ZERO completions on 10 pass attempts after the first quarter ? The defense did its job against the Raiders , but the offense flunked yet another test. Dropped passes, turnovers and ill-timed penalties have turned one of the leagueâs most dangerous offenses over the past five seasons into one of the leagueâs most mistake-prone and disappointing units. Patrick Mahomes is averaging 6.9 yards per attempt (fewer than Desmond Ridder ) and has been forced to use his legs more often, just to get anything started offensively. The Chiefs have only provided a few truly explosive offensive performances the entire season, and those were back in September and October. Itâs hard to imagine that magic suddenly reappearing just in time for the playoffs."
2023,17,10,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,8-7,"It's hard to believe that the same team that lost six of seven through the end of November now has a pretty clear-cut path to the NFC South crown: Tampa just needs to win one of the final two division games remaining. This would be the Bucs' third straight division title, and it would be the least likely of the trio. Baker Mayfield was viewed by some as a bridge QB who, though perhaps able to keep the team competitive in the wake of Tom Brady's retirement, was at a career crossroads. Consider the road crossed. Mayfield has been terrific over the past two weeks, and he's putting together one of his stronger seasons all told, if not his best. Sunday also was a great day for the Bucs' defense, which has had its share of ups and downs, with the big-play factor keeping that unit thriving. This is suddenly a team you must respect."
2023,17,11,Los Angeles Rams,8-7,"I'll admit it: I left the Rams for dead at 3-6. Since the Week 10 bye, though, they've made me look silly with an offense that has really come to life late in the season. Matthew Stafford is reminding everyone how good he still can be. Puka Nacua is out there rewriting the rookie receiving books, while Demarcus Robinson has come up surprisingly huge. Cooper Kupp is still Cooper Kupp. And Kyren Williams has been the engine of it all. The second-year back's return to the lineup, even with a two-fumble first half against Washington in Week 15, has given Los Angeles' offense a huge jolt in the ground game and the aerial attack. And did I mention that Sean McVay has been coaching his tail off most of this season? It would be a shame to see the Rams lose a big game -- maybe even a postseason game -- because of the kicking woes, as they now lead the league with 11 field-goal misses. But the fact we're even talking about them as a possible playoff team is pretty remarkable in its own right."
2023,17,12,Houston Texans,8-7,"The storybook season isnât dead yet, but itâs clear the Texans need C.J. Stroud (concussion) back on the field to keep it alive. Case Keenum struggled in the loss to the Browns , and whatever cosmetic stats Davis Mills racked up in garbage time shouldnât have too much stock put into them. Neither QB was able to complete a pass longer than 18 yards, and through three quarters on Sunday, they combined to complete 12 of 18 throws for 67 yards with two picks and three sacks. Of the two, Mills might be the better option, but Stroud is the only signal-caller who gives the Texans a real chance to (a) get into the playoffs and (b) possibly win a postseason game. The pass defense is a worry, while the ground attack has wavered game to game. If Stroud canât return to rescue this team, the season will still be a success, but it sure would be more memorable with the rookie leading one last rush for the playoffs."
2023,17,13,Jacksonville Jaguars,8-7,"It feels like Jacksonville's season is cratering as I type, with the Jaguars losers of four straight and playing their worst football of the season. The Buccaneers took Sunday's game over in the second quarter and never looked back. The Jaguars still have a mathematically strong chance to make the postseason -- and even win the division. If they do hit the tourney, though, the forecast will still be shaky, even if they start at home. The Jags are 2-5 in games in Jacksonville, losing the past two against playoff-caliber foes. Trevor Lawrence just hasnât had the Year 3 many of us expected -- and now he's dealing with a sprained shoulder -- but itâs hardly all on the quarterback. The Jags have kicking woes, defensive concerns and are not very healthy at wide receiver. Doug Pederson should be commended for his work in turning this franchise around, but it has gone off the rails lately."
2023,17,14,Cincinnati Bengals,8-7,"Jake Browning 's worst game came at a pretty tough time, as did Ja'Marr Chase 's injury. Even if the 34-11 defeat at Pittsburgh wasn't the final stake in Cincinnati's heart, it inflicted a ton of damage to its already-fleeting playoff chances. But there's also a bigger picture to consider for this Bengals season, which has to start with their 0-5 division record. It's been over two decades since Cincinnati went winless in the North, even before Marvin Lewis' time as coach. Joe Burrow started three of those five losses, by the way. The Bengals have changed the arc of the franchise, winning the past two AFC North titles under Zac Taylor, but Saturday's blowout loss revealed a worrisome weakness. They were absolutely dominated on both lines of scrimmage, getting out-toughed by a team with even lower playoff odds and one that was starting its third QB of the season."
2023,17,15,Indianapolis Colts,8-7,"After building up so much goodwill with the 5-1 stretch that started in November, the Colts fell flat in the 29-10 loss to the Falcons. Like in Week 14's 34-14 loss at Cincinnati, Indianapolis was exposed on the road by a competitive team starting its backup quarterback. Gardner Minshew (a replacement QB himself) and Indy's offense struggled after the opening-drive TD , punting on their next four drives. In the fourth quarter, the Colts sandwiched two turnovers on downs around a back-breaking interception . But the defense came up small, too, seeing its 19-game takeaway streak end and registering just one sack of Taylor Heinicke (for no loss) after racking up 25 of them in the previous six games. The Colts have well surpassed many folks' preseason expectations in Year 1 under Shane Steichen, but the feel-good season might be petering out at the very end."
2023,17,16,Seattle Seahawks,8-7,"Geno Smith had a high bar to clear in his return to the lineup, following Drew Lock 's thrilling game-winning drive against the Eagles in Week 15 , and it was a slow burn for Smith on Sunday. But he got cooking late, with the second of two fourth-quarter TD drives giving Seattle a victory it had to have. For now, the Seahawks just want to give Smith a runway into the playoffs if possible, and the next two games ( vs. Pittsburgh , at Arizona ) line up pretty well for him. Whether or not Smith will remain the starter in 2024 is a potential discussion that should be tabled for now. Seattle might not be the most disciplined team in the league, and the level of consistency week to week is a bit too shaky for my taste, but any club with playmakers like the Seahawks have can be a playoff threat."
2023,17,17,Pittsburgh Steelers,8-7,"They're 8-7 with two games left following the shocking domination of the Bengals and still have a remote chance to get into the postseason. We should never doubt a Mike Tomlin-led team, even if the coach has been as questioned by Steelers fans as I can ever remember this season. Back-to-back home losses to teams that arrived at Acrisure Stadium with a 2-10 record can do that, even to the most credentialed coaches in this league. But Tomlin stymied the fans' chants to fire him for at least one game and gave himself a chance to keep his career streak of .500-or-better seasons alive for another year. Mason Rudolph also changed the QB narrative locally with his strong performance in place of Mitch Trubisky , and now Tomlin says the former third-stringer is in line to be Pittsburgh's starter again for this week's game at Seattle . Are the Steelers a good team? Not sure. But fascinating? For sure."
2023,17,18,Minnesota Vikings,7-8,"The Vikings aren't done, but it's getting late. They deserve a ton of credit for keeping the season alive -- and even extending the team's midseason win streak to five games -- after Kirk Cousins was lost for the season. Justin Jefferson was sidelined for that entire hot stretch, so it really is a credit to Kevin O'Connell's and Brian Flores' coaching jobs, getting the most out of their respective units to remain in the playoff race. In Sunday's six-point loss to Detroit, Jefferson put on a show, reminding everyone just how rare he is, whether via his incredible diving TD catch or his improbable conversion in the waning minutes on 3rd-and-27. But that show was also a reminder of what could have been had this team kept its core healthy for more of the season. A 2-0 finish against the Packers and Lions can get the Vikings in the postseason, but they must prepare themselves for the possibility that their largely-inspiring campaign might come up just short."
2023,17,19,Green Bay Packers,7-8,"It's one thing for Baker Mayfield to have one of his best days against the Packers' defense in Week 15 . But it's quite another for Bryce Young -- amid a less-than-stunning rookie season -- to register the first big game of his NFL career against coordinator Joe Barry's unit. Barry has become the latest in that position to earn the fans' wrath, following in a time-honored tradition carried on by Mike Pettine, Dom Capers and Bob Sanders. The Packers ultimately got it done , and it was encouraging to see what a (relatively) healthy Aaron Jones can do for the offense. Green Bay has also had some nice contributions from the likes of Tucker Kraft and Bo Melton . If the Packers can win two more, they're probably in , but that feels like a big ask at this moment. Their playoff odds might have crept up with the narrow victory over Carolina, but my faith in them did not."
2023,17,20,Atlanta Falcons,7-8,"Like the old Monty Python skit, they're not dead yet . The Falcons have plenty of heavy lifting left, with remaining road games at Chicago and New Orleans , and they might need a little help, with the Bucs also winning in Week 16 . But Taylor Heinicke helped save the season for now. After a few dangerous passes in the first half, he settled in and ended up providing the stability the passing game -- and the offense as a whole -- had been craving for weeks. The backs also were a big part of the success, naturally, as Bijan Robinson , Tyler Allgeier and Cordarrelle Patterson were productive as a three-headed monster, both running the ball and in the passing game. It was truly a three-phase victory, with the defense and special teams also coming up big, and it felt like a reminder of all the missed opportunities Atlanta has squandered during a mostly-frustrating season. Arthur Smith and the Falcons might have their backs against the wall, but there's still a chance to salvage this thing and perhaps even earn a home playoff game with some positive turns."
2023,17,21,Las Vegas Raiders,7-8,"Has Antonio Pierce done enough to convince Mark Davis to give him the full-time head-coaching job? Mondayâs stunning win over the Chiefs surely went toward that end. Pierce has had a few warts on his rÃ©sumÃ© since taking over, including a home shutout , but the past two games have been impressive: a 63-21 shellacking of the Chargers and a win at Arrowhead, just the second for the Raiders in the past decade. But donât forget that Davis' last interim coach, Rich Bisaccia, went 7-5 after Jon Grudenâs resignation in 2021 and led the Raiders into the postseason -- then gave way to Josh McDaniels. Pierce sits at 4-3 with two games to play, but heâs coaxed some quality play out of his team. The final two contests could be critical for his future there."
2023,17,22,Denver Broncos,7-8,"Things just didn't look right for Denver from the start on Sunday night, even though the Broncos scored first and the Patriots weren't doing much offensively. But the third quarter was an utter disaster for the home team, as New England logged two offensive touchdowns before notching a shocking special teams scoop-and-score ... while the Broncos netted negative yards. Credit Sean Payton's team for the frantic fourth-quarter comeback, hitting the inside straight with two TDs and two two-point conversions (without Courtland Sutton , who was sidelined in the first quarter by a concussion ). Russell Wilson made plays, with anonymous pass catchers like Lucas Krull and Brandon Johnson stepping up. It could have been a fantastic finish and a huge boost to Denver's playoff chances, but the defense couldn't get one more stop. Payton's first season with the Broncos has been an interesting one, and he's done some really good things, but this three-point loss will sting all offseason, I suspect."
2023,17,23,New Orleans Saints,7-8,"They're getting extra time to prepare for the suddenly-hot Buccaneers, but can the Saints turn this season around? Both Tampa Bay and Atlanta won in Week 16, pushing New Orleans into third place in the NFC South. This past Thursday's loss to the Rams was a wicked setback, as Alvin Kamara was completely contained and some of New Orleans' biggest bugaboos this season (tackling on defense, finishing drives on offense) were exposed once again. The Bucs dominated the Saints in New Orleans in the first meeting back in Week 4 -- and Tampa Bay is arguably a much better team now than it was then, currently riding a four-game win streak. It might be up to Derek Carr and the offense setting the tone in the rematch, and there have been signs of improvement there. But right now, coming from third place to win the division feels like a steep climb -- as does leapfrogging four NFC teams for a wild-card spot ."
2023,17,24,Chicago Bears,6-9,"They've played a very respectable brand of ball following the 0-4 start, going 6-5 since. But we're still left to wonder what might have been had the Bears been a better fourth-quarter operation. Their play in the final 15 minutes recently cost them potentially huge road victories at Detroit and Cleveland -- two teams with double-digit wins -- and opened the door for a possible shocker Sunday against Arizona. The Cardinals were able to cut the Bears' lead from 21-0 to 24-16, as Justin Fields threw a bad fourth-quarter pick to end a promising drive and Chicago's defense sagged too much late. The Bears ultimately finished off three-win Arizona, but they must know that these late-game struggles cannot continue if they want to join the heavyweights of the division."
2023,17,25,New York Jets,6-9,"Even with how the Jets performed early on Sunday , building a 27-7 lead, itâs hard to say they played anything approximating a great game one day after it was reported that both head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas would be back next season . Breece Hall was terrific , bouncing back after a few duds, and the special teams made some big plays early. But how can a defense that completely flustered Sam Howell look so helpless against Jacoby Brissett ? Even if Brissett repeated his effort from the week before against the Rams , outplaying Howell in garbage time, the Jets canât call themselves a top-tier defense and allow things like this to happen. All of this is advanced prep for next season at this point. But Saleh and Douglas still must be judged on what happens now, even if this season is kaput."
2023,17,26,Tennessee Titans,5-10,"Will Levis ' high ankle sprain opened a door for Ryan Tannehill to make a last gasp. There was nothing egregiously bad, but Tannehill just didn't have it in a rusty performance vs. the Seahawks . In the big picture, this could be his final ride with the franchise. Levis is the future, or at least part of it, and Tannehill's contract is not secured beyond 2023 . And he's not the only one whose Titans future remains up in the air. This is a team with several players headed for free agency. You know some name players won't be back. Salary-cap space isn't the issue. This is a 5-10 outfit in what looks like a middling division -- at best -- so the Titans might want to swab the decks and spend the money elsewhere. Derrick Henry rebounded Sunday with a good performance, but he's in the same contractual boat as Tannehill. What about DeAndre Hopkins ? There might be more to play for in the final two games than meets the eye."
2023,17,27,Los Angeles Chargers,5-10,"There still can be interesting developments in lost seasons, and the reduced role of Derwin James in Saturday's tight loss to Buffalo certainly opened my eyes. In essence, he was a nickel corner in the game, taking only a few snaps at safety and playing just 40 of the 52 defensive snaps. James has been an impact player for the Chargers since entering the NFL as a first-round pick in 2018, rarely coming off the field when healthy. But interim coach Giff Smith apparently has a different vision of James' role down the stretch, which could raise questions about his future with the franchise, seeing how he carries a salary-cap hit just south of $20 million in 2024. Now, Smith probably won't be the Chargers' head coach next season, and a new front office is set to take over, so it's impossible to project future personnel decisions. Even still, I'll be keeping an eye on James once the new regime settles in."
2023,17,28,New York Giants,5-10,"I'll be fascinated to see how Brian Daboll handles the quarterback position for the final two games. Not that long ago, it would have been sacrilegious to suggest anyone but Tommy DeVito should get those snaps. Yet Daboll benched DeVito for Tyrod Taylor against the Eagles on Monday , and it looked like the right move, as the Giants fell behind 20-3 with DeVito playing and then outscored the Eagles 22-13 with Taylor out there. Granted, six of those second-half points came on a defensive score , but DeVito wasn't getting it done early. It raises the question as to whether DeVito has somewhat fallen out of favor. I'm not sure that's the case, but the bloom might be off that rose for now. DeVito's ceiling might be as a backup, but how Daboll handles these final games could tell us a lot on that matter."
2023,17,29,New England Patriots,4-11,"Something tells me Bill Belichick isn't as obsessed with the Patriots' draft position as some fans are. The thrilling win at Denver reinforced the idea that the injury-battered Pats have not quit one bit on their embattled coach, as the team now has been blown out twice this season and played in 13 games that were at least pretty close. They've only won four of those contests, which is a problem, of course, but Bailey Zappe has lit a little fire under this team, and the defense is playing pretty darned well, especially considering everything the unit has lost to injury. After missing a 47-yard field goal and an extra point , Chad Ryland atoned with his 56-yard game-winner -- although he's still in the red after massive misses against the Colts and Giants . This isn't a good New England team, but it's a few plays away from having six or seven wins. What the future holds for Belichick is likely only known by him and owner Robert Kraft, but there's an argument to be made that the Pats aren't as far from contending again as some might believe."
2023,17,30,Arizona Cardinals,3-12,"Many Cardinals fans are already thinking about next season, but even so, they must be concerned about Kyler Murray 's uneven play in his abbreviated 2023 campaign. Seeing Arizona's defense struggle isn't the most shocking thing, given that unit's lack of talent and depth following significant attrition this past offseason. But with Murray, there are reasons why it's much more worrisome. The offensive personnel's in better shape, and there are young pieces Arizona plans to build around. Also, first-year coordinator Drew Petzing has displayed some creativity in the face of adversity. Murray, to be fair, has had his moments. But the passing game has stagnated, even if Murray's numbers in Sunday's loss at Chicago looked decent. He's been great in fourth quarters (67.6 percent completions, 486 yards, three TDs), but pretty darned ordinary in the first three quarters (59.4 percent, 819 yards, three TDs). I'll feel better if he finishes strong against Philadelphia and Seattle ."
2023,17,31,Washington Commanders,4-11,"The Sam Howell discussion has turned a little dark in recent weeks, as heâs been upstaged in each of the past two games by Jacoby Brissett in relief. Had that happened earlier in the season, prior to Howell showing some real promise, it might not have been so bad. But there has been a clear regression over the past two weeks, in terms of both Howellâs play (17-of-48 passing, 158 yards, one TD, three picks in that span) and the offenseâs performance with him on the field. Meanwhile, Brissett has led TD drives on five of his past six chances. Is it worth giving the journeyman a couple late-season starts? It might not have any bearing on what happens next season, but it could give Howell a little mental break and allow him to see the game from a different perspective, with a 2024 reboot being the biggest focus."
2023,17,32,Carolina Panthers,2-13,"The Panthers have been more competitive of late, and that trend helped set the table for Bryce Young 's career day in a loss to the Packers . The bottom line is that Young really needed that kind of game before the end of the season, otherwise we wouldn't have a whole lot to point to from his rookie year. Sunday's effort was encouraging, even if it came against an embattled Green Bay defense. Young missed some throws, but he made a number of impressive plays and finally was able to attack vertically with success after struggling to threaten downfield for most of the season, going 6-for-6 for 102 yards and a touchdown on post patterns, per Next Gen Stats."
2023,18,1,Baltimore Ravens,13-3,"Maybe the Bills or a Joe Flacco -led Browns team can come into Baltimore and win in the playoffs. After all, the Ravens have already lost to the Browns at home, and Gardner Minshew won there once . But the way this team is playing reminds me of the Denver Nuggets or Texas Rangers getting white hot at exactly the right time en route to winning the NBA and MLB championships, respectively. If there's an immediate worry, it's in the secondary. Kyle Hamilton and Brandon Stephens missed Sunday's win over Miami, and Marlon Humphrey (calf) and Daryl Worley (stinger) both left the game with injuries. Of course, Baltimore can survive without them in Week 18, with the Ravens having already clinched the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and there will be two weeks of additional healing time before their first playoff game. Regardless, Lamar Jackson 's superpower -- the reason he just feels like the clear-cut MVP right now -- is that he can offset some of your problems and coax an entire team , not just an offense, to turn in a dominant performance any given game."
2023,18,2,San Francisco 49ers,12-4,"As with the Ravens, winning the top seed early ( thanks, Philly! ) and the first-round bye that comes with it was a crucial development for the 49ers, given their deteriorating health, with that No. 1 designation essentially building in an additional week's lag time to get right. They've been running on fumes a bit on defense, and Christian McCaffrey could use a good spa day. He left Sunday's win over Washington with a calf injury, and the focus will be on getting him (and some other key contributors) healthy for the postseason. Can the Niners regain their dominant form? I say yes. The Week 16 loss to the Ravens conjured some of the same concerning feelings we had about San Francisco during the team's three-game losing streak in Weeks 6 through 8. That said, the Week 9 bye really did inject some life into this group. The same thing can happen with the added rest before the first playoff game at Levi's Stadium in a few weeks. If McCaffrey, both lines of scrimmage and Brock Purdy are healthy and mentally sharp, this can be a Super Bowl team, in spite of any recent setbacks."
2023,18,3,Dallas Cowboys,11-5,"They largely played a good game against the Lions , which was important to see, even if it came down to a controversial penalty on Detroit's late two-point conversation. The Cowboys didn't look quite as invulnerable at home as they have for most games at AT&T Stadium over the past few years, letting things start to slip away late on Saturday. The tables certainly turned the following day with the Eagles' loss to the Cardinals, which suddenly made Dallas the massive favorite to clinch the NFC East title in Week 18 . Setting aside Philly's loss, this win was significant for the Cowboys, who otherwise would have extended a losing streak."
2023,18,4,Miami Dolphins,11-5,"The Dolphins were demolished by the Ravens . So why did I move Miami down only one spot? There are some people out there who firmly believe this is a paper tiger of a team, having tallied roughly as many bad losses as impressive wins in December. And I hear you, I really do! But it has felt for some time now that the NFL's top tier consists of two teams, the Ravens and 49ers, and then there's a drop-off to Tier 2, where six or seven squads -- depending on what you think about the Eagles -- are grouped fairly close together. (I did think twice about ranking Dallas ahead of Miami, considering the Dolphins beat the Cowboys in Week 16 .) On their best day, the Dolphins deserve to be high in Tier 2. On days such as Sunday, when they opened the door for the Bills to take the AFC East from them in Week 18, they resemble a team that could be on first-round elimination watch. Even if the Dolphins win a playoff game, would you pick them in a rematch at Baltimore?"
2023,18,5,Detroit Lions,11-5,"The Lions are licking their wounds after the hotly debated two-point play and are now left to wonder what might have been. If they would have beaten the Cowboys , they'd have had a shot to play for the NFC's top seed in Week 18. They're still guaranteed at least the No. 3 seed and a home playoff game, but the loss to Dallas hurts immensely. Once more, this group's resilience will be tested. There is so much to be encouraged by, as the Lions have withstood a number of challenges this season, and they'll be a tough playoff out, especially in Detroit -- but even if they have to go on the road, where they're 6-3 this season, with some quality wins. Dating back to Week 9 of last season, this team's record is 19-7. Dan Campbell and Jared Goff have answered far more questions than they have not. The issue now is whether this team is capable of making a Super Bowl run. In an NFC field where every top contender has had a shaky patch this season, I'll still give Detroit an outside shot right now."
2023,18,6,Buffalo Bills,10-6,"The past two weeks have provided evidence of what I warned about after the Bills' dominant Week 15 win over the Cowboys. It felt like the vast majority of my Power Rankings colleagues the world around leaped them into the top three or four teams -- believe me, I heard plenty about it from you on social media. But I wasn't yet ready to graduate them to the head of the second class. There's no doubt Buffalo has played some clutch football, with a more balanced, composed effort all around. But Sunday's win over the Patriots marked the second straight game in which the Bills struggled to put away a team that will be picking in the top 10 of the 2024 NFL Draft. It's less concerning when the Patriots give the Bills a game, as we're still talking about a Hall of Fame defensive coach on the other sideline. But would Buffalo be able to overcome another sloppy performance in the upcoming for-all-the-division-marbles Week 18 showdown at Miami? That feels like a stretch. There's still some fine-tuning to be done, and the Bills aren't even yet in the postseason. This thing is far from over."
2023,18,7,Cleveland Browns,11-5,"In our search for teams capable of winning it all this season, the Browns make the cut -- even if some still doubt their credentials. They're not doing it in any kind of expected or predictable way, which is how it tends to go for teams that are absolutely ravaged by injury. But you had better believe I am taking seriously a team that has beaten the Ravens and 49ers -- and has seemingly upgraded at quarterback (over P.J. Walker and an injured Deshaun Watson ) since those games. Joe Flacco is getting a little loosey-goosey with the interceptions, but he definitely has the playoff pedigree, big-game nerves and deep-ball arm to will this team on a postseason run. It's possible there is no group better-equipped to deal with the Ravens, because of Flacco and a dominant defense. Cleveland might be the team -- along with Buffalo -- that no one wants to face on the AFC side. You could even argue the Browns are more dangerous than Buffalo, and I might not put up much of a fight, even as banged up as Cleveland is."
2023,18,8,Kansas City Chiefs,10-6,"It's easy, and quite fair, to say that the Chiefs are not the team we expected them to be this season. But that doesn't mean they can't make some noise still. Sunday's win over the Bengals provided a snapshot of how they could reinvent themselves on the fly and potentially reemerge in the playoffs as a threat. Defense and Isiah Pacheco are the two elements that give Kansas City the best chance. Now, don't twist my words; I am not saying Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are incapable of leading a hot January run. Of course they are. But right now, the aerial game is operating at a passable level; meanwhile, the Chiefs' defense and Pacheco (when healthy) have been the two biggest X-factors. The defense shut out Cincinnati for the final 36-plus minutes on Sunday, including a massive fourth-down stop midway through the third quarter, and Pacheco was the offense early on. We give Tom Brady ultimate credit for the Super Bowl rings he won in 2018 with the Patriots and 2020 with the Bucs, but those teams had a similar makeup to these Chiefs in a few ways."
2023,18,9,Philadelphia Eagles,11-5,"After beating the Bills in overtime in Week 12 , the Eagles stood at 10-1. They had the slight MVP favorite in Jalen Hurts . Their offense and defense had ranked among the top 10 in the NFL at various points in the season. And then? December brought an abject collapse, including one tighter-than-it-should've-been win over the Giants and four losses. The Eagles failed to surpass 19 points scored in three of those defeats. They've allowed 51 points in 60 second-half minutes at home vs. the Giants and Cardinals over the past two weeks. It was utterly bizarre that every time I tuned in to Sunday's loss to Arizona , the Cardinals had the ball. Philly has now coughed up control of the NFC East and must face the reality of having to play on the road in the playoffs, barring something wacky happening in Week 18. Are the Eagles cooked? I won't completely bail, but they're very much on double-secret probation and might be irreparable. This isn't exactly Constantinople falling, but it's shocking, nonetheless."
2023,18,10,Los Angeles Rams,9-7,"I believe this is the start of the NFL's Tier 3, with the drop from Tier 2 being much smaller than the gap between Tier 2 and Tier 1, as the flagging Eagles muddy the waters a bit. The Rams are a threat, no doubt -- both to opponents and to themselves . They secured a spot in the playoffs, where they're capable of pulling a road shocker and perhaps just as likely to allow the other team to steal the game late. Since the big Week 13 win over the Browns, the Rams have lost to the Ravens in overtime in Baltimore and hung on for three skin-of-their-teeth victories (having led in all three games by double digits) over teams sitting outside of the current playoff picture. The kicking situation has been part of the problem, with two missed FG tries and two missed XP attempts in that four-game span. For the season, Rams kickers have missed a combined 15 tries, the worst mark in the NFL. Matthew Stafford , Kyren Williams and the receivers give Los Angeles a real chance to make noise, but there's an undeniable volatility about this team."
2023,18,11,Houston Texans,9-7,"C.J. Stroud returned to action Sunday , and all was right in the world. He'll march into Lucas Oil Stadium this Saturday night , in his biggest game since he and Ohio State lost to Georgia in the Peach Bowl one year ago, with a chance to lead his Texans into the postseason (and possibly to an AFC South title) as a rookie. But it's going to have to be more than just about Stroud. The last time the Texans faced the Colts, Stroud threw for 384 yards -- and lost. A whole season has unfolded since then ( Anthony Richardson started that game for Indy), as Houston was struggling with its offensive line and run game at the time. So Week 18 will feel like a completely different matchup, I suspect, especially if the Texans can get healthy. Will Anderson Jr. returned Sunday with a timely two-sack performance. Getting sack leader Jonathan Greenard and DT Maliek Collins back on the field would be big developments."
2023,18,12,Jacksonville Jaguars,9-7,"Even if it came against the league's worst team, Sunday's victory was important for a number of reasons. First, it kept the Jaguars breathing in the playoff race and kept the door open for a division title. Second, playing a turnover-free, one-penalty game with Trevor Lawrence on the sideline for the first time in his NFL career is not anything to sneeze at. Even if the red-zone offense (1-for-5 on Sunday) was an ugly sight, the rest of the performance belied all the things that went wrong during Jacksonville's horrific December downturn. The Jaguars averaged 2.5 turnovers and 5.5 penalties per game in four consecutive losses ahead of Sunday. Whether or not a season that started with an 8-3 record can be salvaged remains very much up in the air, but the Jaguars are alive for now, and they're facing a win-and-in Week 18 contest at Tennessee -- almost the same spot they were in one year ago."
2023,18,13,Indianapolis Colts,9-7,"Arguably the second-best game of Week 18: The contest between the Texans and Colts in Indianapolis , with a playoff spot -- and possibly the AFC South title -- hanging in the balance. It would have been fun to see two rookie QBs face off, but that has been off the table for months now, as Gardner Minshew just keeps chugging along for the Colts in Anthony Richardson 's stead, making enough big plays to keep the offense afloat. Indianapolis' defensive numbers against the pass are fairly respectable, even if the Colts haven't exactly faced the league's toughest QB schedule of all time this season. C.J. Stroud stung them back in Week 2 , and rookie Aidan O'Connell (299 yards, two TDs) carved them up a bit Sunday . Getting CB Kenny Moore (who missed the win over the Raiders) back and having a healthy RB Jonathan Taylor in Week 18 could do wonders. Taylor was in and out of the Raiders game, but he was effective when he played. Selfishly, I just want an all-hands-on-deck battle in this divisional showdown. It should be a doozy."
2023,18,14,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,8-8,"Week 17's showing was not what we expected, with Tampa trailing 20-zip well into the fourth quarter against the desperate Saints. The Bucs entered the game oozing with confidence, having put together their best stretch of the season through the first four weeks of December. They then reverted back to some old, bad habits in the loss, putting themselves in a win-or-else situation in Week 18. That Sunday's opponents are the lowly Panthers provides little solace. If they had beaten the Saints, the Bucs could have clinched a playoff spot, which would have allowed them to determine how they'd want to handle Week 18, with the option of resting select players if needed. That luxury has come and gone, and Tampa Bay must clean up the mistakes it made in all three phases of the game. I considered dropping the Bucs even farther, especially as Baker Mayfield is now dealing with some sore ribs , but for now, they lie just on the playoff cusp , which feels about right."
2023,18,15,Pittsburgh Steelers,9-7,"Mason Rudolph earned the Week 18 start against the Ravens with his second straight cool-handed performance, the kind of thing Pittsburgh has lacked at quarterback for much of this season. There were other factors of note in the massive win at Seattle, including a tone-setting run game and just enough impact plays on defense. The Steelers kept the Seahawks out of the end zone for the final 35-plus minutes Sunday, coming up with the big turnover they needed: Nick Herbig 's strip-sack of Geno Smith with seven minutes left. Even if Pittsburgh can't beat the Ravens in Baltimore on Saturday, Rudolph's late-season bloom has added a fascinating wrinkle to the Steelers' QB situation long term. Perhaps it's all moot, and Kenny Pickett returns to starting in 2024. But hear me out: What if Rudolph gets Pittsburgh into the playoffs ?"
2023,18,16,Green Bay Packers,8-8,"The Packers' first post- Aaron Rodgers season opened with a win over the Bears , and it will take a reprise of that Sunday -- at Lambeau Field -- to get Jordan Love and Green Bay into the postseason . Chicago is a far different team than it was the last time around, arguably just as hot as the Packers down the stretch, with both teams having won five of their past seven games. Love reached the 30-TD mark in Sunday's win over the Vikings . Don't look now, but he's had a really impressive season on the whole. Week 1 hero Aaron Jones is back, too, turning in a 120-yard rushing performance against Minnesota. And assuming Jayden Reed is healthy , he's proving to be a rookie star in the making. Matt LaFleur has never lost to the Bears, who haven't won in Green Bay since 2015. Week 18 will add another terrific chapter to this historic rivalry, with the playoffs on the line and a feisty Chicago team that would love nothing more than to spoil a Pack party."
2023,18,17,New Orleans Saints,8-8,"It was nice to see the middling Saints play their best all-around game this season in a now-or-never situation, thoroughly thumping the Buccaneers in Tampa. But could they not have performed like that sooner? Because of some earlier-season losses to teams they're now going head-to-head against for playoff spots , the Saints need to beat Atlanta and receive help to get into the postseason . But the NFC South remains open, and as much of a long shot as it might be, in this season -- especially in that division -- it's safe to say we should not assume anything is going to happen as expected. One big development Sunday was Derek Carr delivering a dialed-in performance. I believe the chances of Carr being back in New Orleans next season as the Saints' starter are higher than they were a month ago. Let's see how Week 18 plays out, though, before we start forecasting what their offseason might look like."
2023,18,18,Cincinnati Bengals,8-8,"The Bengals allowed the Chiefs to gain 373 yards of offense in Sunday's loss -- not an obscene total by any means, but the most Kansas City has had in a game since October. And examining the way those yards were compiled helps frame the Bengals' lost season. The Chiefs' six longest gains totaled 225 yards, which was more than 60 percent of their game total -- six big plays allowed. That has been Cincinnati's biggest problem all season along, perhaps underscoring what Jessie Bates III (who signed with the Falcons last offseason) meant to this defense, even if it's hard to imagine that one safety could carry that much weight. According to Next Gen Stats, the Bengals enter Week 18 ranked last in the league in rushing defensive success rate (54.9%) and second-to-last in passing defensive success (51.2%). The wrist injury that ended Joe Burrow 's season in November dealt the biggest blow to the Bengals' Super Bowl chances, but the defensive breakdowns might have short-circuited this team even if Burrow had stayed healthy."
2023,18,19,Seattle Seahawks,8-8,"The Seahawks entered Week 17 controlling their own destiny, needing wins in their final two games to guarantee a playoff berth. Uh, yeah, about that ... Perhaps allowing 178 rush yards after contact to a Steelers team that was averaging fewer than 90 rush yards in the previous three games wasn't a winning formula. It also didn't help that Kenneth Walker III , who made some noise early in the game, was injured in the third quarter and missed most of the second half. After Walker recovered his own fumble on a direct snap midway through the third quarter, the Seahawks handed off one more time on their final 20 plays of the game. Walker's one appearance in the fourth quarter came on the strip-sack of Geno Smith , and the RB's chip left a bit to be desired. The Seahawks' surest path to the playoffs now? Beating a highly competitive Cardinals team in Week 18 and having the Bears defeat the Packers. That's not completely improbable, but it's hard to assume it'll happen."
2023,18,20,Chicago Bears,7-9,"The Bears have the perfect offseason springboard opportunity lying ahead: a chance to knock the Packers out of the playoffs in Green Bay . The season began with Jordan Love and the Packers outplaying Justin Fields and the Bears at Soldier Field , and the potential payback couldn't be much sweeter. Stop me if you've heard this before, but most arrows are pointing upward in Chicago. On the day the Bears secured the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Fields sent his stock soaring by beating the tar out of the Falcons . The franchise certainly has some massive decisions ahead, but chants of ""We want Justin!"" on Sunday let Chicago's front office know where a lot of fans stand on the quarterback situation. If Fields can play well and lead a successful Week 18 siege of Lambeau Field, those decisions might become even easier."
2023,18,21,Minnesota Vikings,7-9,"Transcribing the Week 18 scenarios that would allow Minnesota to back-door its way into the playoffs would use up most of my word count, so let's get down to some raw facts. The Vikings' shorthanded defense might have been the biggest culprit in Sunday's crushing loss to the Packers, but that unit has banked enough cred with the wholesale improvements ( without a massive talent increase) it's made since last year. We all know that the Vikings' QB situation after Kirk Cousins ' season-ending Achilles injury was the real underlying issue, leading to a weekly Press Your Luck -style game show for Kevin O'Connell to land on an able replacement. Unfortunately, KOC hit too many whammies down the stretch, and the wheel was still spinning Monday, when no starter had yet been named for the regular-season finale . If you're a Vikings fan who was in their feels watching a shirtless Cousins lead the ""SKOL"" chant before Sunday's game, you're probably not alone. Is there a chance he's back as QB1 in 2024? A month ago, I'm not sure what answer I'd have given, but now? Absolutely yes."
2023,18,22,Denver Broncos,8-8,"Denver resurrected itself after a 1-5 start to the season that included a 50-point drubbing -- but winning six of seven games (including five straight) apparently just delayed the inevitable. Eventually, it seems the arranged marriage between Sean Payton and Russell Wilson is likely to come to an end in some form or another, and it might not be the cleanest divorce in history. It will be interesting to see how much of a chance Jarrett Stidham gets as the starter next season. Playing a lower-salaried starting QB would have its obvious appeals, and Payton could opt to pair Stidham with a promising rookie as a way of potentially offsetting Wilson's imminent dead-money salary-cap hit, should Wilson be cut. Stidham was fine Sunday in his first start with the team, but that one game alone did little to suggest he's the no-questions-asked favorite to be QB1 in 2024. There's still a lot to sort out -- and with Payton running the show, things are seldom bland."
2023,18,23,Las Vegas Raiders,7-9,"There's no question interim head coach Antonio Pierce has pulled the Raiders out of a midseason tailspin after the ouster of Josh McDaniels. They were 3-5 under McDaniels with a minus-61 point differential. Even taking into account Sunday's loss to the Colts, the Raiders have gone 4-4 with a plus-49 differential under Pierce. But is it enough to convince owner Mark Davis to hire Pierce for the full-time job? A Week 18 win over the rival Broncos could help Pierce's cause. But if not, we might look back at the missed opportunities against the Vikings ( a 3-0 home loss ) and Sunday's defeat, which knocked the Raiders out of the playoffs , as the difference. There are some big-name candidates who could be on the market this offseason, potentially including one particular college coach who got his NFL coaching start with the franchise."
2023,18,24,Atlanta Falcons,7-9,"On Sunday morning, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero indicated Falcons head coach Arthur Smith and general manager Terry Fontenot are likely to remain in their posts in 2024 -- and then the Falcons went out and laid an egg in Chicago , with a playoff spot still up for grabs. Hope of reaching the postseason remains, although it has dimmed considerably, thanks to the Falcons' insistence on being unreliable from game to game. One week, they're handing the Panthers their second win of the season; the next, they're blasting an underrated Colts squad; then they're flopping again in the snow in Chicago. The Falcons aren't built to be a comeback team. Their largest deficit overcome this season was 12 points back in Week 2 at home. So a comeback after trailing by two TDs at halftime Sunday seemed like a pretty dodgy proposition. Whether the Falcons back their way into the playoffs or not, we will likely be able to ultimately say quarterback limitations did this team in this season. It's hard to imagine Atlanta trying to run back the same QB room next season and expecting different results."
2023,18,25,New York Jets,6-10,"Robert Saleh has called his defense a "" championship-caliber "" unit, but Thursday's performance against the Browns did not fit that label . Even factoring in a lost season and measuring the motivation of an eliminated team playing on a short week on the road, the Jets gave us another reason to question whether this franchise truly is one healthy Aaron Rodgers away from jumping right back into contention next season. Because I could point to a host of issues that arose after Rodgers' injury (including a five-game losing streak and poor rushing marks on both sides of the ball) that have little to do with who was playing quarterback as evidence that, well, they might not be. We know that a lot of the team will look the same, with Rodgers and Saleh expected back . But my hope is that the Jets have some honest conversations about the state of the roster this offseason. Simply running it back doesn't feel like a winning strategy in and of itself."
2023,18,26,Tennessee Titans,5-11,"You can't really blame the Titans for wanting to play Will Levis in Week 17 a week after he missed a game with a high ankle sprain, even if he eventually would be knocked out of Sunday's loss , too, after a strip-sack (which the Texans ran back for a score). Ryan Tannehill had some moments in his place, hitting on his first nine passes and throwing for 168 yards in about 40 minutes of ball, but he was also sacked five times in his 25 dropbacks. That's the biggest issue for 2024: getting the blocking right. It has been a problem for a few seasons now, and it hurt the chances of Levis -- the possible QB1 next season -- to stack some important performances at season's end, with next year in mind."
2023,18,27,Los Angeles Chargers,5-11,"It was interesting hearing the CBS broadcast crew continue to talk about the Chargers being a talented team, albeit one that has been ravaged by injury this season. That might be true, but even taking the injuries into account, I've started to question whether the Chargers actually are among the league's more talented clubs. Especially considering the high-priced veterans who might not be back, along with a host of young players who have yet to fully realize their potential -- or, as in the case of some offensive linemen, who have taken a step backward in their development. I still think that whoever ends up running this team will be taking on a relatively attractive job, with Justin Herbert and a few other pieces in place. But when one considers their salary-cap situation (projected to be almost $35 million in the red in 2024, per Over The Cap ) and the veterans who might be lost this offseason, the roster might not be as stacked as some assume."
2023,18,28,New York Giants,5-11,"The Giants sure are fascinating. There are ample reasons why this team is slated to pick in the top five of the draft this spring, and some of them have been known since their 40-0 Week 1 blowout loss to Dallas. Other flaws have taken longer to manifest themselves, cropping up over a few wild months that included a three-game winning streak and a three-game losing streak. The encouraging part is that the Giants beat the Packers in Week 14 and had a chance to win against the playoff-bound Eagles in Week 16 and Rams on Sunday . Ultimately, too many self-inflicted mistakes prevented those feel-good upsets from taking place, but at least Brian Daboll has the Giants playing with some kind of purpose down the stretch. Bigger issues will be addressed in the weeks to come, but the effort question is a nice one to put to bed after this disappointing season."
2023,18,29,Arizona Cardinals,4-12,"The Cardinals have relished the spoiler role, starting with their Week 3 shocker over the Cowboys and continuing right through to Sunday's bigger stunner against the Eagles. Despite not scoring a touchdown in the first 36 minutes of the game in Philly, the Cards controlled the clock, erasing a 15-point deficit on the road with four TDs in their four second-half possessions. The offense has caught a little bit of fire lately, ringing up its second game in three outings with 200-plus rush yards and crossing the 30-point mark for the first time all season. For that to happen in such a big setting was a huge boost for first-year offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and QB Kyler Murray , who have formed a quality tandem in their initial season together."
2023,18,30,New England Patriots,4-12,"We still have no clarity on Bill Belichick's status going forward, as he has continued to mostly deflect on that line of questioning. But how to view Bailey Zappe -- regardless of whether Belichick is back in 2024 -- seems pretty clear to me. In a league where 61 quarterbacks have started at least one game this season, it's obvious that having a true starter and a quality backup is important. And to me, Zappe falls more in line with the latter category than the former. He's energized the Patriots since his late-season promotion, giving them a better chance to win close games than Mac Jones did. But Zappe's three-interception game on Sunday revealed some of his limitations as a passer, even if he's not operating in the best environment for any quarterback to thrive. If I am running the Patriots this offseason, with a high draft pick incoming , I am employing whatever means I can to find a star talent at the position and not settling for a caretaker and some lukewarm competition."
2023,18,31,Washington Commanders,4-12,"We've watched Sam Howell crest and fall multiple times, and another strange week was a nice little encapsulation of his strange season. Howell was benched heading into Week 17 after being outplayed by Jacoby Brissett . Then, Brissett suffered a hamstring injury later in the week, and Howell was reinserted as the starter against the 49ers . Howell actually responded to the challenge well, at least early on, looking poised and confident while completing nine of his 13 passes for 100 yards and a TD in the first half. But his propensity for turnovers re-emerged after halftime, when he threw two ill-advised picks, the first of which came in the fourth quarter when Washington was threatening to make it a one-score contest. Instead, the 49ers turned Howell's first INT into a 27-10 lead, and his second pick pretty much sealed up the Commanders' loss. Whoever is calling the shots for Washington next season likely won't accept the poor ball security we've seen from Howell, who hasn't gone more than one game without a pick all year."
2023,18,32,Carolina Panthers,2-14,"This was probably the low-water point of the season, being shut out by the struggling Jaguars, who were starting a backup QB -- especially after a stretch in which the Panthers played a more competitive brand of football, beating the Falcons and nearly taking down the Packers. It was doubly painful that Sunday's loss directly led to the Bears clinching the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft -- the selection that Carolina traded away to Chicago last spring in order to draft Bryce Young . Their 2022 first-rounder, Ikem Ekownu , had a difficult time trying to block the Jaguars' Josh Allen , continuing Ekwonu's rough Year 2. His future forecast (along with that of Young) remains cloudy right now. A dose of new offensive coaching blood might be able to fix some of this mess, but the O-line could use two or more new starters, and Young likely needs at least that many quality receiving options added to the till."
2023,19,1,Baltimore Ravens,13-3,"Maybe the Bills or a Joe Flacco -led Browns team can come into Baltimore and win in the playoffs. After all, the Ravens have already lost to the Browns at home, and Gardner Minshew won there once . But the way this team is playing reminds me of the Denver Nuggets or Texas Rangers getting white hot at exactly the right time en route to winning the NBA and MLB championships, respectively. If there's an immediate worry, it's in the secondary. Kyle Hamilton and Brandon Stephens missed Sunday's win over Miami, and Marlon Humphrey (calf) and Daryl Worley (stinger) both left the game with injuries. Of course, Baltimore can survive without them in Week 18, with the Ravens having already clinched the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and there will be two weeks of additional healing time before their first playoff game. Regardless, Lamar Jackson 's superpower -- the reason he just feels like the clear-cut MVP right now -- is that he can offset some of your problems and coax an entire team , not just an offense, to turn in a dominant performance any given game."
2023,19,2,San Francisco 49ers,12-4,"As with the Ravens, winning the top seed early ( thanks, Philly! ) and the first-round bye that comes with it was a crucial development for the 49ers, given their deteriorating health, with that No. 1 designation essentially building in an additional week's lag time to get right. They've been running on fumes a bit on defense, and Christian McCaffrey could use a good spa day. He left Sunday's win over Washington with a calf injury, and the focus will be on getting him (and some other key contributors) healthy for the postseason. Can the Niners regain their dominant form? I say yes. The Week 16 loss to the Ravens conjured some of the same concerning feelings we had about San Francisco during the team's three-game losing streak in Weeks 6 through 8. That said, the Week 9 bye really did inject some life into this group. The same thing can happen with the added rest before the first playoff game at Levi's Stadium in a few weeks. If McCaffrey, both lines of scrimmage and Brock Purdy are healthy and mentally sharp, this can be a Super Bowl team, in spite of any recent setbacks."
2023,19,3,Dallas Cowboys,11-5,"They largely played a good game against the Lions , which was important to see, even if it came down to a controversial penalty on Detroit's late two-point conversation. The Cowboys didn't look quite as invulnerable at home as they have for most games at AT&T Stadium over the past few years, letting things start to slip away late on Saturday. The tables certainly turned the following day with the Eagles' loss to the Cardinals, which suddenly made Dallas the massive favorite to clinch the NFC East title in Week 18 . Setting aside Philly's loss, this win was significant for the Cowboys, who otherwise would have extended a losing streak."
2023,19,4,Miami Dolphins,11-5,"The Dolphins were demolished by the Ravens . So why did I move Miami down only one spot? There are some people out there who firmly believe this is a paper tiger of a team, having tallied roughly as many bad losses as impressive wins in December. And I hear you, I really do! But it has felt for some time now that the NFL's top tier consists of two teams, the Ravens and 49ers, and then there's a drop-off to Tier 2, where six or seven squads -- depending on what you think about the Eagles -- are grouped fairly close together. (I did think twice about ranking Dallas ahead of Miami, considering the Dolphins beat the Cowboys in Week 16 .) On their best day, the Dolphins deserve to be high in Tier 2. On days such as Sunday, when they opened the door for the Bills to take the AFC East from them in Week 18, they resemble a team that could be on first-round elimination watch. Even if the Dolphins win a playoff game, would you pick them in a rematch at Baltimore?"
2023,19,5,Detroit Lions,11-5,"The Lions are licking their wounds after the hotly debated two-point play and are now left to wonder what might have been. If they would have beaten the Cowboys , they'd have had a shot to play for the NFC's top seed in Week 18. They're still guaranteed at least the No. 3 seed and a home playoff game, but the loss to Dallas hurts immensely. Once more, this group's resilience will be tested. There is so much to be encouraged by, as the Lions have withstood a number of challenges this season, and they'll be a tough playoff out, especially in Detroit -- but even if they have to go on the road, where they're 6-3 this season, with some quality wins. Dating back to Week 9 of last season, this team's record is 19-7. Dan Campbell and Jared Goff have answered far more questions than they have not. The issue now is whether this team is capable of making a Super Bowl run. In an NFC field where every top contender has had a shaky patch this season, I'll still give Detroit an outside shot right now."
2023,19,6,Buffalo Bills,10-6,"The past two weeks have provided evidence of what I warned about after the Bills' dominant Week 15 win over the Cowboys. It felt like the vast majority of my Power Rankings colleagues the world around leaped them into the top three or four teams -- believe me, I heard plenty about it from you on social media. But I wasn't yet ready to graduate them to the head of the second class. There's no doubt Buffalo has played some clutch football, with a more balanced, composed effort all around. But Sunday's win over the Patriots marked the second straight game in which the Bills struggled to put away a team that will be picking in the top 10 of the 2024 NFL Draft. It's less concerning when the Patriots give the Bills a game, as we're still talking about a Hall of Fame defensive coach on the other sideline. But would Buffalo be able to overcome another sloppy performance in the upcoming for-all-the-division-marbles Week 18 showdown at Miami? That feels like a stretch. There's still some fine-tuning to be done, and the Bills aren't even yet in the postseason. This thing is far from over."
2023,19,7,Cleveland Browns,11-5,"In our search for teams capable of winning it all this season, the Browns make the cut -- even if some still doubt their credentials. They're not doing it in any kind of expected or predictable way, which is how it tends to go for teams that are absolutely ravaged by injury. But you had better believe I am taking seriously a team that has beaten the Ravens and 49ers -- and has seemingly upgraded at quarterback (over P.J. Walker and an injured Deshaun Watson ) since those games. Joe Flacco is getting a little loosey-goosey with the interceptions, but he definitely has the playoff pedigree, big-game nerves and deep-ball arm to will this team on a postseason run. It's possible there is no group better-equipped to deal with the Ravens, because of Flacco and a dominant defense. Cleveland might be the team -- along with Buffalo -- that no one wants to face on the AFC side. You could even argue the Browns are more dangerous than Buffalo, and I might not put up much of a fight, even as banged up as Cleveland is."
2023,19,8,Kansas City Chiefs,10-6,"It's easy, and quite fair, to say that the Chiefs are not the team we expected them to be this season. But that doesn't mean they can't make some noise still. Sunday's win over the Bengals provided a snapshot of how they could reinvent themselves on the fly and potentially reemerge in the playoffs as a threat. Defense and Isiah Pacheco are the two elements that give Kansas City the best chance. Now, don't twist my words; I am not saying Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are incapable of leading a hot January run. Of course they are. But right now, the aerial game is operating at a passable level; meanwhile, the Chiefs' defense and Pacheco (when healthy) have been the two biggest X-factors. The defense shut out Cincinnati for the final 36-plus minutes on Sunday, including a massive fourth-down stop midway through the third quarter, and Pacheco was the offense early on. We give Tom Brady ultimate credit for the Super Bowl rings he won in 2018 with the Patriots and 2020 with the Bucs, but those teams had a similar makeup to these Chiefs in a few ways."
2023,19,9,Philadelphia Eagles,11-5,"After beating the Bills in overtime in Week 12 , the Eagles stood at 10-1. They had the slight MVP favorite in Jalen Hurts . Their offense and defense had ranked among the top 10 in the NFL at various points in the season. And then? December brought an abject collapse, including one tighter-than-it-should've-been win over the Giants and four losses. The Eagles failed to surpass 19 points scored in three of those defeats. They've allowed 51 points in 60 second-half minutes at home vs. the Giants and Cardinals over the past two weeks. It was utterly bizarre that every time I tuned in to Sunday's loss to Arizona , the Cardinals had the ball. Philly has now coughed up control of the NFC East and must face the reality of having to play on the road in the playoffs, barring something wacky happening in Week 18. Are the Eagles cooked? I won't completely bail, but they're very much on double-secret probation and might be irreparable. This isn't exactly Constantinople falling, but it's shocking, nonetheless."
2023,19,10,Los Angeles Rams,9-7,"I believe this is the start of the NFL's Tier 3, with the drop from Tier 2 being much smaller than the gap between Tier 2 and Tier 1, as the flagging Eagles muddy the waters a bit. The Rams are a threat, no doubt -- both to opponents and to themselves . They secured a spot in the playoffs, where they're capable of pulling a road shocker and perhaps just as likely to allow the other team to steal the game late. Since the big Week 13 win over the Browns, the Rams have lost to the Ravens in overtime in Baltimore and hung on for three skin-of-their-teeth victories (having led in all three games by double digits) over teams sitting outside of the current playoff picture. The kicking situation has been part of the problem, with two missed FG tries and two missed XP attempts in that four-game span. For the season, Rams kickers have missed a combined 15 tries, the worst mark in the NFL. Matthew Stafford , Kyren Williams and the receivers give Los Angeles a real chance to make noise, but there's an undeniable volatility about this team."
2023,19,11,Houston Texans,9-7,"C.J. Stroud returned to action Sunday , and all was right in the world. He'll march into Lucas Oil Stadium this Saturday night , in his biggest game since he and Ohio State lost to Georgia in the Peach Bowl one year ago, with a chance to lead his Texans into the postseason (and possibly to an AFC South title) as a rookie. But it's going to have to be more than just about Stroud. The last time the Texans faced the Colts, Stroud threw for 384 yards -- and lost. A whole season has unfolded since then ( Anthony Richardson started that game for Indy), as Houston was struggling with its offensive line and run game at the time. So Week 18 will feel like a completely different matchup, I suspect, especially if the Texans can get healthy. Will Anderson Jr. returned Sunday with a timely two-sack performance. Getting sack leader Jonathan Greenard and DT Maliek Collins back on the field would be big developments."
2023,19,12,Jacksonville Jaguars,9-7,"Even if it came against the league's worst team, Sunday's victory was important for a number of reasons. First, it kept the Jaguars breathing in the playoff race and kept the door open for a division title. Second, playing a turnover-free, one-penalty game with Trevor Lawrence on the sideline for the first time in his NFL career is not anything to sneeze at. Even if the red-zone offense (1-for-5 on Sunday) was an ugly sight, the rest of the performance belied all the things that went wrong during Jacksonville's horrific December downturn. The Jaguars averaged 2.5 turnovers and 5.5 penalties per game in four consecutive losses ahead of Sunday. Whether or not a season that started with an 8-3 record can be salvaged remains very much up in the air, but the Jaguars are alive for now, and they're facing a win-and-in Week 18 contest at Tennessee -- almost the same spot they were in one year ago."
2023,19,13,Indianapolis Colts,9-7,"Arguably the second-best game of Week 18: The contest between the Texans and Colts in Indianapolis , with a playoff spot -- and possibly the AFC South title -- hanging in the balance. It would have been fun to see two rookie QBs face off, but that has been off the table for months now, as Gardner Minshew just keeps chugging along for the Colts in Anthony Richardson 's stead, making enough big plays to keep the offense afloat. Indianapolis' defensive numbers against the pass are fairly respectable, even if the Colts haven't exactly faced the league's toughest QB schedule of all time this season. C.J. Stroud stung them back in Week 2 , and rookie Aidan O'Connell (299 yards, two TDs) carved them up a bit Sunday . Getting CB Kenny Moore (who missed the win over the Raiders) back and having a healthy RB Jonathan Taylor in Week 18 could do wonders. Taylor was in and out of the Raiders game, but he was effective when he played. Selfishly, I just want an all-hands-on-deck battle in this divisional showdown. It should be a doozy."
2023,19,14,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,8-8,"Week 17's showing was not what we expected, with Tampa trailing 20-zip well into the fourth quarter against the desperate Saints. The Bucs entered the game oozing with confidence, having put together their best stretch of the season through the first four weeks of December. They then reverted back to some old, bad habits in the loss, putting themselves in a win-or-else situation in Week 18. That Sunday's opponents are the lowly Panthers provides little solace. If they had beaten the Saints, the Bucs could have clinched a playoff spot, which would have allowed them to determine how they'd want to handle Week 18, with the option of resting select players if needed. That luxury has come and gone, and Tampa Bay must clean up the mistakes it made in all three phases of the game. I considered dropping the Bucs even farther, especially as Baker Mayfield is now dealing with some sore ribs , but for now, they lie just on the playoff cusp , which feels about right."
2023,19,15,Pittsburgh Steelers,9-7,"Mason Rudolph earned the Week 18 start against the Ravens with his second straight cool-handed performance, the kind of thing Pittsburgh has lacked at quarterback for much of this season. There were other factors of note in the massive win at Seattle, including a tone-setting run game and just enough impact plays on defense. The Steelers kept the Seahawks out of the end zone for the final 35-plus minutes Sunday, coming up with the big turnover they needed: Nick Herbig 's strip-sack of Geno Smith with seven minutes left. Even if Pittsburgh can't beat the Ravens in Baltimore on Saturday, Rudolph's late-season bloom has added a fascinating wrinkle to the Steelers' QB situation long term. Perhaps it's all moot, and Kenny Pickett returns to starting in 2024. But hear me out: What if Rudolph gets Pittsburgh into the playoffs ?"
2023,19,16,Green Bay Packers,8-8,"The Packers' first post- Aaron Rodgers season opened with a win over the Bears , and it will take a reprise of that Sunday -- at Lambeau Field -- to get Jordan Love and Green Bay into the postseason . Chicago is a far different team than it was the last time around, arguably just as hot as the Packers down the stretch, with both teams having won five of their past seven games. Love reached the 30-TD mark in Sunday's win over the Vikings . Don't look now, but he's had a really impressive season on the whole. Week 1 hero Aaron Jones is back, too, turning in a 120-yard rushing performance against Minnesota. And assuming Jayden Reed is healthy , he's proving to be a rookie star in the making. Matt LaFleur has never lost to the Bears, who haven't won in Green Bay since 2015. Week 18 will add another terrific chapter to this historic rivalry, with the playoffs on the line and a feisty Chicago team that would love nothing more than to spoil a Pack party."
2023,19,17,New Orleans Saints,8-8,"It was nice to see the middling Saints play their best all-around game this season in a now-or-never situation, thoroughly thumping the Buccaneers in Tampa. But could they not have performed like that sooner? Because of some earlier-season losses to teams they're now going head-to-head against for playoff spots , the Saints need to beat Atlanta and receive help to get into the postseason . But the NFC South remains open, and as much of a long shot as it might be, in this season -- especially in that division -- it's safe to say we should not assume anything is going to happen as expected. One big development Sunday was Derek Carr delivering a dialed-in performance. I believe the chances of Carr being back in New Orleans next season as the Saints' starter are higher than they were a month ago. Let's see how Week 18 plays out, though, before we start forecasting what their offseason might look like."
2023,19,18,Cincinnati Bengals,8-8,"The Bengals allowed the Chiefs to gain 373 yards of offense in Sunday's loss -- not an obscene total by any means, but the most Kansas City has had in a game since October. And examining the way those yards were compiled helps frame the Bengals' lost season. The Chiefs' six longest gains totaled 225 yards, which was more than 60 percent of their game total -- six big plays allowed. That has been Cincinnati's biggest problem all season along, perhaps underscoring what Jessie Bates III (who signed with the Falcons last offseason) meant to this defense, even if it's hard to imagine that one safety could carry that much weight. According to Next Gen Stats, the Bengals enter Week 18 ranked last in the league in rushing defensive success rate (54.9%) and second-to-last in passing defensive success (51.2%). The wrist injury that ended Joe Burrow 's season in November dealt the biggest blow to the Bengals' Super Bowl chances, but the defensive breakdowns might have short-circuited this team even if Burrow had stayed healthy."
2023,19,19,Seattle Seahawks,8-8,"The Seahawks entered Week 17 controlling their own destiny, needing wins in their final two games to guarantee a playoff berth. Uh, yeah, about that ... Perhaps allowing 178 rush yards after contact to a Steelers team that was averaging fewer than 90 rush yards in the previous three games wasn't a winning formula. It also didn't help that Kenneth Walker III , who made some noise early in the game, was injured in the third quarter and missed most of the second half. After Walker recovered his own fumble on a direct snap midway through the third quarter, the Seahawks handed off one more time on their final 20 plays of the game. Walker's one appearance in the fourth quarter came on the strip-sack of Geno Smith , and the RB's chip left a bit to be desired. The Seahawks' surest path to the playoffs now? Beating a highly competitive Cardinals team in Week 18 and having the Bears defeat the Packers. That's not completely improbable, but it's hard to assume it'll happen."
2023,19,20,Chicago Bears,7-9,"The Bears have the perfect offseason springboard opportunity lying ahead: a chance to knock the Packers out of the playoffs in Green Bay . The season began with Jordan Love and the Packers outplaying Justin Fields and the Bears at Soldier Field , and the potential payback couldn't be much sweeter. Stop me if you've heard this before, but most arrows are pointing upward in Chicago. On the day the Bears secured the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Fields sent his stock soaring by beating the tar out of the Falcons . The franchise certainly has some massive decisions ahead, but chants of ""We want Justin!"" on Sunday let Chicago's front office know where a lot of fans stand on the quarterback situation. If Fields can play well and lead a successful Week 18 siege of Lambeau Field, those decisions might become even easier."
2023,19,21,Minnesota Vikings,7-9,"Transcribing the Week 18 scenarios that would allow Minnesota to back-door its way into the playoffs would use up most of my word count, so let's get down to some raw facts. The Vikings' shorthanded defense might have been the biggest culprit in Sunday's crushing loss to the Packers, but that unit has banked enough cred with the wholesale improvements ( without a massive talent increase) it's made since last year. We all know that the Vikings' QB situation after Kirk Cousins ' season-ending Achilles injury was the real underlying issue, leading to a weekly Press Your Luck -style game show for Kevin O'Connell to land on an able replacement. Unfortunately, KOC hit too many whammies down the stretch, and the wheel was still spinning Monday, when no starter had yet been named for the regular-season finale . If you're a Vikings fan who was in their feels watching a shirtless Cousins lead the ""SKOL"" chant before Sunday's game, you're probably not alone. Is there a chance he's back as QB1 in 2024? A month ago, I'm not sure what answer I'd have given, but now? Absolutely yes."
2023,19,22,Denver Broncos,8-8,"Denver resurrected itself after a 1-5 start to the season that included a 50-point drubbing -- but winning six of seven games (including five straight) apparently just delayed the inevitable. Eventually, it seems the arranged marriage between Sean Payton and Russell Wilson is likely to come to an end in some form or another, and it might not be the cleanest divorce in history. It will be interesting to see how much of a chance Jarrett Stidham gets as the starter next season. Playing a lower-salaried starting QB would have its obvious appeals, and Payton could opt to pair Stidham with a promising rookie as a way of potentially offsetting Wilson's imminent dead-money salary-cap hit, should Wilson be cut. Stidham was fine Sunday in his first start with the team, but that one game alone did little to suggest he's the no-questions-asked favorite to be QB1 in 2024. There's still a lot to sort out -- and with Payton running the show, things are seldom bland."
2023,19,23,Las Vegas Raiders,7-9,"There's no question interim head coach Antonio Pierce has pulled the Raiders out of a midseason tailspin after the ouster of Josh McDaniels. They were 3-5 under McDaniels with a minus-61 point differential. Even taking into account Sunday's loss to the Colts, the Raiders have gone 4-4 with a plus-49 differential under Pierce. But is it enough to convince owner Mark Davis to hire Pierce for the full-time job? A Week 18 win over the rival Broncos could help Pierce's cause. But if not, we might look back at the missed opportunities against the Vikings ( a 3-0 home loss ) and Sunday's defeat, which knocked the Raiders out of the playoffs , as the difference. There are some big-name candidates who could be on the market this offseason, potentially including one particular college coach who got his NFL coaching start with the franchise."
2023,19,24,Atlanta Falcons,7-9,"On Sunday morning, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero indicated Falcons head coach Arthur Smith and general manager Terry Fontenot are likely to remain in their posts in 2024 -- and then the Falcons went out and laid an egg in Chicago , with a playoff spot still up for grabs. Hope of reaching the postseason remains, although it has dimmed considerably, thanks to the Falcons' insistence on being unreliable from game to game. One week, they're handing the Panthers their second win of the season; the next, they're blasting an underrated Colts squad; then they're flopping again in the snow in Chicago. The Falcons aren't built to be a comeback team. Their largest deficit overcome this season was 12 points back in Week 2 at home. So a comeback after trailing by two TDs at halftime Sunday seemed like a pretty dodgy proposition. Whether the Falcons back their way into the playoffs or not, we will likely be able to ultimately say quarterback limitations did this team in this season. It's hard to imagine Atlanta trying to run back the same QB room next season and expecting different results."
2023,19,25,New York Jets,6-10,"Robert Saleh has called his defense a "" championship-caliber "" unit, but Thursday's performance against the Browns did not fit that label . Even factoring in a lost season and measuring the motivation of an eliminated team playing on a short week on the road, the Jets gave us another reason to question whether this franchise truly is one healthy Aaron Rodgers away from jumping right back into contention next season. Because I could point to a host of issues that arose after Rodgers' injury (including a five-game losing streak and poor rushing marks on both sides of the ball) that have little to do with who was playing quarterback as evidence that, well, they might not be. We know that a lot of the team will look the same, with Rodgers and Saleh expected back . But my hope is that the Jets have some honest conversations about the state of the roster this offseason. Simply running it back doesn't feel like a winning strategy in and of itself."
2023,19,26,Tennessee Titans,5-11,"You can't really blame the Titans for wanting to play Will Levis in Week 17 a week after he missed a game with a high ankle sprain, even if he eventually would be knocked out of Sunday's loss , too, after a strip-sack (which the Texans ran back for a score). Ryan Tannehill had some moments in his place, hitting on his first nine passes and throwing for 168 yards in about 40 minutes of ball, but he was also sacked five times in his 25 dropbacks. That's the biggest issue for 2024: getting the blocking right. It has been a problem for a few seasons now, and it hurt the chances of Levis -- the possible QB1 next season -- to stack some important performances at season's end, with next year in mind."
2023,19,27,Los Angeles Chargers,5-11,"It was interesting hearing the CBS broadcast crew continue to talk about the Chargers being a talented team, albeit one that has been ravaged by injury this season. That might be true, but even taking the injuries into account, I've started to question whether the Chargers actually are among the league's more talented clubs. Especially considering the high-priced veterans who might not be back, along with a host of young players who have yet to fully realize their potential -- or, as in the case of some offensive linemen, who have taken a step backward in their development. I still think that whoever ends up running this team will be taking on a relatively attractive job, with Justin Herbert and a few other pieces in place. But when one considers their salary-cap situation (projected to be almost $35 million in the red in 2024, per Over The Cap ) and the veterans who might be lost this offseason, the roster might not be as stacked as some assume."
2023,19,28,New York Giants,5-11,"The Giants sure are fascinating. There are ample reasons why this team is slated to pick in the top five of the draft this spring, and some of them have been known since their 40-0 Week 1 blowout loss to Dallas. Other flaws have taken longer to manifest themselves, cropping up over a few wild months that included a three-game winning streak and a three-game losing streak. The encouraging part is that the Giants beat the Packers in Week 14 and had a chance to win against the playoff-bound Eagles in Week 16 and Rams on Sunday . Ultimately, too many self-inflicted mistakes prevented those feel-good upsets from taking place, but at least Brian Daboll has the Giants playing with some kind of purpose down the stretch. Bigger issues will be addressed in the weeks to come, but the effort question is a nice one to put to bed after this disappointing season."
2023,19,29,Arizona Cardinals,4-12,"The Cardinals have relished the spoiler role, starting with their Week 3 shocker over the Cowboys and continuing right through to Sunday's bigger stunner against the Eagles. Despite not scoring a touchdown in the first 36 minutes of the game in Philly, the Cards controlled the clock, erasing a 15-point deficit on the road with four TDs in their four second-half possessions. The offense has caught a little bit of fire lately, ringing up its second game in three outings with 200-plus rush yards and crossing the 30-point mark for the first time all season. For that to happen in such a big setting was a huge boost for first-year offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and QB Kyler Murray , who have formed a quality tandem in their initial season together."
2023,19,30,New England Patriots,4-12,"We still have no clarity on Bill Belichick's status going forward, as he has continued to mostly deflect on that line of questioning. But how to view Bailey Zappe -- regardless of whether Belichick is back in 2024 -- seems pretty clear to me. In a league where 61 quarterbacks have started at least one game this season, it's obvious that having a true starter and a quality backup is important. And to me, Zappe falls more in line with the latter category than the former. He's energized the Patriots since his late-season promotion, giving them a better chance to win close games than Mac Jones did. But Zappe's three-interception game on Sunday revealed some of his limitations as a passer, even if he's not operating in the best environment for any quarterback to thrive. If I am running the Patriots this offseason, with a high draft pick incoming , I am employing whatever means I can to find a star talent at the position and not settling for a caretaker and some lukewarm competition."
2023,19,31,Washington Commanders,4-12,"We've watched Sam Howell crest and fall multiple times, and another strange week was a nice little encapsulation of his strange season. Howell was benched heading into Week 17 after being outplayed by Jacoby Brissett . Then, Brissett suffered a hamstring injury later in the week, and Howell was reinserted as the starter against the 49ers . Howell actually responded to the challenge well, at least early on, looking poised and confident while completing nine of his 13 passes for 100 yards and a TD in the first half. But his propensity for turnovers re-emerged after halftime, when he threw two ill-advised picks, the first of which came in the fourth quarter when Washington was threatening to make it a one-score contest. Instead, the 49ers turned Howell's first INT into a 27-10 lead, and his second pick pretty much sealed up the Commanders' loss. Whoever is calling the shots for Washington next season likely won't accept the poor ball security we've seen from Howell, who hasn't gone more than one game without a pick all year."
2023,19,32,Carolina Panthers,2-14,"This was probably the low-water point of the season, being shut out by the struggling Jaguars, who were starting a backup QB -- especially after a stretch in which the Panthers played a more competitive brand of football, beating the Falcons and nearly taking down the Packers. It was doubly painful that Sunday's loss directly led to the Bears clinching the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft -- the selection that Carolina traded away to Chicago last spring in order to draft Bryce Young . Their 2022 first-rounder, Ikem Ekownu , had a difficult time trying to block the Jaguars' Josh Allen , continuing Ekwonu's rough Year 2. His future forecast (along with that of Young) remains cloudy right now. A dose of new offensive coaching blood might be able to fix some of this mess, but the O-line could use two or more new starters, and Young likely needs at least that many quality receiving options added to the till."
